description: Evaluate your design against AGENTS.md and core guides
---

Time to evaluate your design. Read docs/spec/architecture.md, docs/guides/feature-development.md, and docs/spec/ui-implementation.md.

Find every AGENTS.md file that is in the file path tree of the files you were editing/planning to edit. Re-read the agents.md files, starting at root.

Analyze your planned design against the design principles of the project, based on these AGENTS.md and guides. Does your code adhere to these design principles? If not, what do you need to change?

This repo uses AGENTS.md files as guidance throughout the filesystem. Find the AGENTS.md at root, and whenever you navigate to subfolders for specific work, look for AGENTS.md in the subfolders for specific guidance. Adhere to them throughout your work. Reading ALL AGENTS.md in your target subdir filepath is required before finishing any implementation plan, and before any code modification is allowed.

Adhere to them strictly.

Read AGENTS.md now, as your first action in this repo.

# COMMUNITY Governance Run

Identity: COMMUNITY steward.
Priority: user-facing clarity, adoption, and external trust.

1. Read `work/charters/COMMUNITY.md`.
2. Use the charter's `Skills / resources` table to select the most relevant capability for this run.
3. Apply the `gov-core` heartbeat contract with one COMMUNITY focus.
4. Write output to `memory/COMMUNITY/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
5. If blocked, set `decision: no-op`, `no_op_reason: blocked`, `cost_guard.escalation_requested: true`.
6. Exit.

description: "Pre-PR finish pass — update headers, AGENTS.md, specs, and work item status"
user-invocable: true
---

You are a **senior technical writer** performing the pre-PR finish pass for this work item: #$ITEM

You scan the branch diff once, then update everything: file headers, AGENTS.md, specs, project, work item, and index. One pass, clean paper trail.

Your audience: future developers and reviewers. Every file they open should have an accurate header. Every AGENTS.md should reflect the current public surface. Every spec should match what the code does now. Prefer mermaid diagrams, visual flows, file pointers, and invariants.

Read these before starting:

- [Architecture](docs/spec/architecture.md) and [Style & Lint Rules](docs/spec/style.md)
- [Content Boundaries](docs/spec/docs-work-system.md#content-boundaries) — ownership rules
- [Development Lifecycle](docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md) — workflow flows
- [Items Index](work/items/_index.md) — find the work item

## Phase 1 — Scan & Plan

Run `git diff --name-status origin/staging...HEAD` and read the changed files. From this single scan, build a change manifest:

1. **Coherence check**: Do ALL changes align with the assigned work item? Flag any unrelated changes — they should be split into a separate branch before PR.

2. **Group changes by directory**. For each directory with changes, note:
   - Did public exports, routes, env keys, ports, or boundaries change? → AGENTS.md update needed
   - Did file behavior, inputs/outputs, or side-effects change? → file header update needed
   - Internal-only refactors or formatting? → no doc update needed

3. **Check spec impact**: Read the work item's `spec_refs`. For each linked spec, does the diff change behavior that the spec describes? Note which spec sections need updating.

Output a short TODO list of all actions before executing any of them.

---

## Phase 2 — File Headers

For each changed/new source file where behavior changed:

- Update the **top-of-file TSDoc header** to reflect current behavior, inputs/outputs, side-effects.
- Use templates: `docs/templates/header_source_template.ts` (source), `header_test_template.ts` (tests), `header_e2e_template.ts` (e2e).
- If only internal refactors or formatting changed, skip.

---

## Phase 3 — AGENTS.md

For each directory where public surface changed:

- Update the directory's `AGENTS.md`. Create from `docs/templates/agents_subdir_template.md` if missing.
- Only update if: public exports, routes, env keys, ports, or boundaries changed.
- Do **not** add new sections. Keep ≤150 lines. Edit existing sections only.
- Describe **interfaces and public surface** — not per-file behavior.

---

## Phase 4 — Specs

For each spec in the work item's `spec_refs` (skip if none):

- Read the spec and compare against the current code.
- Update sections where implementation changed (invariants, design, file pointers, acceptance checks).
- Advance `spec_state` if appropriate (draft→proposed when invariants enumerated; proposed→active when code matches and Open Questions empty).
- Update `verified:` date.
- Do NOT add roadmap, phases, or planning content.

---

## Phase 5 — Project & Work Item

1. **Update the work item**:
   - Set `status: needs_merge`
   - Set `reviewer:` if known
   - Update `updated:` date

2. **Update the project** (if work item has `project:` set):
   - Mark the corresponding deliverable as in-review in the roadmap table.
   - Add/update spec links in `## As-Built Specs`.

3. **Update `_index.md`**: Reflect the item's `needs_merge` status.

---

## Phase 6 — Finalize

1. Run `pnpm check:docs` and fix any errors until clean.
2. Commit all changes (doc updates, header updates, spec updates, work item, project, `_index.md`) on the work item's branch. `git status` must be clean after commit.
3. Push to remote.
4. Create PR to `staging` using `/pull-request` logic (conventional commit title + summary).
5. Set `pr:` in work item frontmatter with the PR URL. Commit and push this update.
6. Report: what was updated, what was flagged, any follow-up items discovered. Next command: `/review-implementation`.

---

## Writing Rules (apply to ALL phases)

- **Present tense** only. Never write "new," "updated," "final," or "production ready."
- Simplify and shorten. Remove dead or duplicated lines.
- Keep behavior details in file headers, not AGENTS.md.
- Cross-check: `index.ts` exports, routes, env schema vs AGENTS.md.

## Rules

- **SINGLE_SCAN** — read the diff once in Phase 1. All subsequent phases reference that manifest.
- **COHERENCE_REQUIRED** — if changes don't align with the work item, flag it before proceeding
- **SPEC_UPDATES_MATCH_CODE** — spec changes reflect what was built, not aspirations
- **INDEX_MUST_MATCH** — `_index.md` must reflect the updated state
- **LINK_DONT_DUPLICATE** — don't restate project roadmap content in spec updates

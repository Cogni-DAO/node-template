# Database Operations — Backups, Pooling & Credential Management

> Source: docs/DATABASE_OPS_SPEC.md (roadmap content extracted during docs migration)

## Goal

Adopt Supabase OSS building blocks (WAL-G, optionally Supavisor/pgBouncer) — not the full Supabase platform — to close critical infrastructure gaps: no backups, stale credentials, no connection pooling. The application, RLS model, provisioner, and DSN contract remain unchanged.

> [!CRITICAL]
> **No backup exists today.** A single `docker volume rm` or disk failure results in total data loss. This is the highest-priority gap in the current infrastructure.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Backups (data loss mitigation)

**Goal:** WAL-G continuous archiving to S3-compatible storage (Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, or MinIO).

| Deliverable                                        | Status      | Est | Work Item |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------- |
| WAL-G sidecar/cron container in docker-compose     | Not Started | 2   | —         |
| `postgresql.conf` overrides (archive_mode, etc.)   | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Backup secrets provisioning per environment        | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Nightly `pg_basebackup` + continuous WAL archiving | Not Started | 2   | —         |
| Restore runbook in `platform/runbooks/`            | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Monthly restore test cadence with evidence         | Not Started | 1   | —         |

**Recovery Targets:**

| Target                  | Value      | Rationale                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RPO** (max data loss) | ~5 minutes | Continuous WAL archiving; loss window = unarchived WAL since last flush |
| **RTO** (max downtime)  | < 1 hour   | Base backup restore + WAL replay to a fresh container                   |

These are initial targets for a single-VM deployment. Adjust when moving to managed Postgres or multi-region.

**Retention Policy:**

| Artifact                | Retention         | Storage                                               |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Full base backups       | 7 daily, 4 weekly | S3-compatible (R2/B2)                                 |
| WAL archive segments    | 30 days           | Same bucket, `/wal/` prefix                           |
| Oldest restorable point | 30 days           | Determined by oldest retained base backup + WAL chain |

WAL-G's `delete retain` handles garbage collection of expired backups.

**Compose Changes:**

- Add `wal-g` sidecar or cron container with access to `postgres_data` volume
- Add backup-specific env vars: `WALG_S3_PREFIX`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Nightly `pg_basebackup` + continuous WAL archiving
- Add `postgresql.conf` overrides: `archive_mode = on`, `archive_command` pointing to WAL-G

**New Secrets (per environment):**

| Secret                         | Description                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `BACKUP_S3_ENDPOINT`           | S3-compatible endpoint URL |
| `BACKUP_S3_BUCKET`             | Bucket name                |
| `BACKUP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Storage credentials        |
| `BACKUP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Storage credentials        |

**Restore Runbook & Testing:**

A restore runbook must be written in `platform/runbooks/` covering:

1. Pull latest base backup from S3
2. Restore to throwaway container with WAL replay to target timestamp
3. Verify row counts / schema version / spot-check application data
4. Document restore time and any issues

**Restore test cadence:** Monthly. Each test produces evidence artifacts:

| Artifact                                                                                     | Purpose                      |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Restore log (stdout capture)                                                                 | Proof that restore completed |
| Timestamp of backup used                                                                     | Proves RPO claim             |
| Wall-clock restore duration                                                                  | Proves RTO claim             |
| Schema version check (`SELECT * FROM drizzle.__drizzle_migrations ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1`) | Data integrity verification  |

Evidence is stored in the S3 bucket under `/restore-tests/YYYY-MM-DD/`.

**Scope boundary:** No app code changes. No DSN changes. No provisioner changes.

### Walk (P1) — Credential Convergence

**Goal:** Eliminate "stale volume keeps old password" class of bugs. Provision becomes convergent: create-or-update, not create-or-skip.

| Deliverable                                    | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Dedicated `app_migrator` role (DDL separated)  | Not Started | 2   | task.0055            |
| `provision.sh` gains `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |
| Credential rotation evidence in deploy logs    | Not Started | 1   | (create at P1 start) |

Already tracked in DATABASE_RLS_SPEC.md P1:

> Credential rotation support: `provision.sh` should `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` for existing roles, not skip them

**Scope boundary:** `provision.sh` only. No app code changes.

### Run (P2) — Connection Pooler

**Goal:** Add pgBouncer between app and Postgres. Hard trust boundary.

| Deliverable                                           | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| pgBouncer service in docker-compose on `internal` net | Not Started | 2   | (create at P2 start) |
| DSN host repoint: `postgres:5432` → `pgbouncer:6432`  | Not Started | 1   | (create at P2 start) |
| Network segmentation (db-only network for postgres)   | Not Started | 1   | (create at P2 start) |

**Trust-boundary requirements:**

- App/migrate/scheduler-worker containers must not have network access to `postgres:5432` — only to `pgbouncer:6432`. Enforce via Docker network segmentation (pooler on `internal`, postgres on a `db-only` network).
- pgBouncer auth config (`userlist.txt` or `auth_query`) must not log or expose passwords. Use `auth_type = scram-sha-256`.
- pgBouncer admin console (`pgbouncer` virtual database) must be disabled or bound to localhost only.

**Why defer:** Current connection count is low (single app + scheduler-worker). Pooling becomes valuable at higher concurrency or if Postgres moves to managed/external hosting.

**Scope boundary:** DSN host changes + network topology. No app code changes. No RLS changes.

### Per-Node Schema Independence

**Goal:** Each node owns its DB schema — no cross-node table leak, no shared migration numbering.

| Deliverable                                                                                       | Status       | Est | Work Item                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Per-node drizzle configs + per-node migrator images + legacy purge                                | done         | 2   | task.0324 ([PR #916](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/916))   |
| Migrator rebased on runtime image (`FROM runner AS migrator` + drizzle-orm programmatic migrator) | done         | 2   | task.0370 ([PR #1041](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/1041)) |
| Migrations as Deployment initContainer + retire `cogni-template-migrate` GHCR build               | in-review    | 2   | task.0371 ([PR #1043](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/1043)) |
| Un-no-op prod poly/resy migration Jobs (gated on DB inspection)                                   | obviated     | —   | superseded by task.0371 — Jobs deleted entirely                              |
| **Future:** Atlas + GitOps migrations (declarative schema, CRD)                                   | needs_design | 5   | task.0325                                                                    |

**As-shipped state after task.0371:**

- Each node app ships a single runtime image; `cogni-template-migrate` GHCR package retired.
- Migrations run as a Deployment initContainer (`base/node-app/deployment.yaml`) using the same image as the main container; CMD reads `NODE_NAME` from configmap and invokes `node /app/nodes/$(NODE_NAME)/app/migrate.mjs ...`.
- Postgres migrators (operator/poly/resy) wrap `migrate()` in a blocking `pg_advisory_lock(0x436f676e6901)` — single-writer guard for concurrent initContainers (replicas > 1, HPA scale-out, rolling-update overlap). Drizzle's journal makes the post-acquire migration a no-op when schema is already current.
- Poly Doltgres runs as a second initContainer in the poly Deployment (added via overlay patch on candidate-a + preview only — production-poly doesn't run Doltgres). The Doltgres script does **not** wrap in advisory lock today: support is unverified and postgres.js extended-protocol has known compat gaps. Single-writer is fine at `replicas: 1`.
- Argo PreSync hook Jobs are gone everywhere; `wait-for-argocd.sh` lost ~80 lines of hook-Job babysitting.

**Remaining open items:**

- Doltgres advisory-lock validation when poly scales beyond `replicas: 1` (multi-writer Doltgres safety).
- task.0325 — Atlas / declarative schema / destructive-change linting — when contributor scale warrants it.
- task.0390 — flatten `nodes/node-template/` migration baseline so future forks (canary `ai-only`, etc.) don't inherit 27 historical entries + the same intermediate-snapshot gap pattern bug.0389 fixed in poly.

### Snapshot Chain Integrity (bug.0389)

**Goal:** every node's drizzle migration chain is verifiable in CI; hand-authored migrations don't silently rot the chain head.

| Deliverable                                                                                   | Status   | Est | Work Item |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| Wire `pnpm db:check` (drizzle-kit upstream `check` per node) into pre-commit + pre-push       | **done** | 1   | bug.0389  |
| Repair poly chain — fix 0027/0028 collision + restore chain HEAD so `db:generate:poly` works  | **done** | 1   | bug.0389  |
| `databases.md §2.6` hand-authored migration recipe + hard rule against editing prior `prevId` | **done** | —   | bug.0389  |
| Flatten `nodes/node-template/` migration baseline before next fork (canary `ai-only`)         | proposed | 2   | task.0390 |

**As-shipped state after bug.0389:**

- `pnpm db:check` runs `drizzle-kit check` against every drizzle config (operator + resy + poly Postgres + poly Doltgres). Wired into both `scripts/check-fast.sh` (pre-push) and `scripts/check-all.sh` (pre-commit). Catches the failure mode that let PR #930 silently land a self-referential snapshot.
- Hand-authored RLS/trigger migrations remain a real pattern (drizzle-kit `generate` can't model them). The recipe in `databases.md §2.6` is now the maintained contract: copy prior snapshot, regenerate `id`, set `prevId`, edit `tables` block, commit both files together.
- Poly chain head is `meta/0033_snapshot.json` (synthesized in bug.0389 from current schema.ts). Intermediate snapshots 0011, 0015, 0024–0026, 0029–0032 remain absent — `drizzle-kit check` tolerates the gap; only the head matters for `generate`.

### Migrator Image Layer Sharing (task.0370 — bug.0368)

**Goal:** kill the per-flight migrator image-pull tax. Pre-task.0370 migrator was `FROM base` with full dev `node_modules` (~480 MB unique blob). k3s pulled it cold every flight (~3m45s per affected node), turning candidate-flight verify-candidate into a 4–9 min wait while the migration itself ran in ~8 s.

| Follow-up: runner image bloat (~285 MB codex SDK)                                                                                            | needs_triage | 1   | bug.0369 (file)                                           |
| Follow-up: `wait-for-argocd.sh` `clear_stale_missing_hook_operation` only fires once → wedged apps after first kick are unrecoverable        | needs_triage | 1   | bug.0370-followup (file)                                  |

**Hard invariant inherited:** `FORWARD_COMPAT_MIGRATIONS` — migrations must be backward-compatible with the prior app version. Rolling-update overlap means old pods serve traffic against the new schema briefly. Same obligation as before task.0370; made explicit in [databases.md](../../docs/spec/databases.md) §5.2.

### P3 — DSN-Only Provisioning

**Goal:** 3 DSNs become the only database secrets.

| Deliverable                                  | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Provisioner parses DSNs with real URL parser | Not Started | 2   | (create at P3 start) |
| `APP_DB_*` component secrets deleted         | Not Started | 1   | (create at P3 start) |

Already tracked in DATABASE_URL_ALIGNMENT_SPEC.md P1-P2:

- Provisioner parses `DATABASE_ROOT_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_SERVICE_URL` with a real URL parser
- `APP_DB_*` component secrets deleted
- 3 DSNs become the only database secrets

**Scope boundary:** provision.sh rewrite + secret cleanup. No app code changes.

## Constraints

- Postgres remains our database — no platform migration
- Only adopt Supabase OSS building blocks, NOT the full self-hosted platform
- RLS dual-role architecture (`app_user` + `app_service`) stays unchanged
- Each phase has explicit scope boundaries — no app code changes in P0-P2

## Enterprise Readiness Alignment

| Control                                                                           | Phase                       | Evidence                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Availability** — data recoverable after failure                                 | P0 (backups)                | Monthly restore test artifacts (logs, timestamps, schema check)                            |
| **Access control integrity** — credentials converge to intended state             | P1 (credential convergence) | Provision logs show `ALTER ROLE` on every deploy, not just first run                       |
| **Access control boundary** — app cannot bypass pooler to reach Postgres directly | P2 (pooler)                 | Network segmentation in compose; no direct `postgres:5432` route from app                  |
| **Auditability** — high-risk DB ops are recorded                                  | P0+                         | Backup/restore operations logged to S3 with timestamps; deploy events already emit to Loki |

**Observability scope for DB ops:** Record backup runs, restore tests, and credential rotation events as structured log entries (Pino → Loki). Per-request/per-job actor context is already handled by the RLS `SET LOCAL` pattern. We do not add per-query audit logging — that's `pg_audit` territory (tracked in DATABASE_RLS_SPEC.md P1).

## What We Explicitly Do NOT Do

- **Self-host full Supabase stack.** We don't need their auth, storage, realtime, or API gateway. We already have Postgres + RLS + explicit DSNs + provisioner.
- **Move to managed Postgres (RDS, Supabase hosted, Neon).** Not ruled out long-term, but not required to solve the current gaps. If we do, P0-P2 still apply (backups become provider-managed, pooler becomes provider PgBouncer).
- **Change the RLS model.** The dual-role architecture (`app_user` + `app_service`) is correct and stays.

## Dependencies

- [x] Postgres deployment (existing)
- [x] RLS model (existing — DATABASE_RLS_SPEC.md)
- [ ] S3-compatible storage account (R2/B2/MinIO)

## As-Built Specs

- [databases.md](../../docs/spec/databases.md) — §2 Migration Strategy + §4 Technical Implementation updated for per-node drizzle configs + per-node migrator images (task.0324).

| **Never** | Adopt Supabase Realtime for AI streaming                      | N/A                            | assistant-stream works well               |

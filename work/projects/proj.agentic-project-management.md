# DAO Agentic Project Management

## Goal

Replace the current pattern of agents hand-editing YAML frontmatter with a structured `WorkItemPort` that models work items, relations, assignees, and external references as first-class domain concepts. Markdown files remain the canonical store (adapter v0), but all access goes through the port — enabling future adapters (DB, OpenProject, Plane) without rewriting agents.

The end state: users "claim" work items via the app UI, dispatch agents (Cogni, Claude Code, Codex) to execute them, and track progress through structured status transitions — not file diffs.

## Context

### What exists today

- Work items are `.md` files with YAML frontmatter in `work/items/`
- ~~`src/lib/work-scanner.ts`~~ — replaced by `WorkItemQueryPort` (task.0158)
- `scripts/validate-docs-metadata.mjs` — CI validation of frontmatter schema
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/enrichers/work-item-linker.ts` — regex extraction of work item IDs from PR metadata
- `docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md` — status-driven command dispatch spec
- `claimed_by_run` / `claimed_at` / `last_command` fields — governance runner locking (specced, not wired)

### What's broken

1. **Agents edit frontmatter directly** — race conditions, formatting drift, no concurrency control
2. **ID collisions** — `next-work-id.mjs` exists but isn't used programmatically (bug.0147 collision)
3. **No structured relations** — `blocked_by` is a CSV string, no first-class dependency graph
4. **PR linking is regex-only** — no enforcement, no bidirectional linking
5. **No agent assignment model** — `assignees` is `string[]` with no type, no identity binding
6. **No audit trail** — status changes only visible in git history

### Identity model alignment

Per `docs/spec/identity-model.md`, assignees must map to the **actor model**:

- `actor_id` (UUID) is the economic subject — earns, spends, gets attributed
- Actor kinds: `user | agent | system | org`
- `user` actors have 1:1 FK to `users.id`
- `agent` actors have optional `parent_actor_id` for hierarchy
- `@cogni/ids` exports branded `ActorId` / `UserId` types

The port's `SubjectRef` must align with actor kinds so that when the `actors` table lands (story.0117), assignment is a simple FK.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — WorkItemPort + Markdown Adapter

**Goal:** All agent work-item access goes through a typed port. Markdown remains source of truth. Zero external dependencies.

| Migrate remaining skills (`/closeout`, `/review-implementation`, `/bug`, `/idea`) | Not Started | 2   | (create after task.0152) |

### Walk (P1) — Relations, External Refs, PR Linking

**Goal:** Dependencies are a first-class graph. PRs are linked automatically. Work items are queryable by relation.

| Deliverable                                                             | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

### Run (P2) — Agent Dispatch + User Claiming

**Goal:** Users claim work items from the UI and dispatch agents to execute them. Agents report status back through the port.

| Deliverable                                                                      | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

### Sprint (P3) — Doltgres Source-of-Truth + External Tracker Integration

**Goal:** Doltgres replaces markdown as the canonical work-item store. Markdown remains a deprecated local convenience. Port contract unchanged for consumers; only adapter + types extended (`node` column).

| Deliverable                                                                                | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

| One-shot markdown → Doltgres importer + dashboard facade rewire (operator v1)              | Not Started | 2   | (create after 0423)  |
| Transition state-machine + `expectedRevision` concurrency + relations/external-refs tables | Not Started | 3   | (create after 0423)  |
| Propagate Doltgres work-item plane to other nodes (or keep operator-only) — TBD            | Not Started | 3   | (create after v1)    |
| Obsidian-compatible export (markdown derived from Doltgres for git-tracked audit)          | Not Started | 2   | (create after v1)    |
| OpenProject adapter (REST API, user mapping) — optional                                    | Not Started | 3   | (create at P3 start) |
| Plane adapter (MCP server integration) — optional                                          | Not Started | 2   | (create at P3 start) |

## Port Design

### Core types

```typescript
// ── Identity ──────────────────────────────────────────
// Aligned with docs/spec/identity-model.md actor kinds
// and @cogni/ids branded types

type WorkItemId = string; // e.g., "task.0149", "bug.0148"
type Revision = string; // content hash or frontmatter version

type SubjectRef =
  | { kind: "user"; userId: string } // maps to users.id → actor_id (kind=user)
  | { kind: "agent"; agentId: string } // maps to future actors.id (kind=agent)
  | { kind: "system"; serviceId: string }; // maps to future actors.id (kind=system)

// ── External references ───────────────────────────────
// Backend-agnostic: works with GitHub, GitLab, Plane, OpenProject

type ExternalRef = {
  system: string; // "github" | "gitlab" | "plane" | "openproject" | ...
  kind: string; // "pull_request" | "issue" | "branch" | "commit" | "url" | ...
  externalId?: string;
  url?: string;
  title?: string;
};

// ── Relations ─────────────────────────────────────────
// Canonical direction only — store "blocks", derive "blocked_by" at query time.
// This avoids double-storage and consistency drift.

type RelationType =
  | "blocks" // A blocks B (inverse: blocked_by)
  | "parent_of" // A is parent of B (inverse: child_of)
  | "relates_to" // symmetric
  | "duplicates"; // A duplicates B

type WorkRelation = {
  fromId: WorkItemId;
  toId: WorkItemId;
  type: RelationType;
};

// ── Status ────────────────────────────────────────────
// From docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md — the port enforces these transitions.

type WorkItemStatus =
  | "needs_triage"
  | "needs_research"
  | "needs_design"
  | "needs_implement"
  | "needs_closeout"
  | "needs_merge"
  | "done"
  | "blocked"
  | "cancelled";

// ── Work item ─────────────────────────────────────────

type WorkItem = {
  id: WorkItemId;
  type: "task" | "bug" | "story" | "spike" | "subtask";
  title: string;
  status: WorkItemStatus;
  priority?: number;
  rank?: number;
  estimate?: number;
  summary?: string;
  outcome?: string;
  projectId?: WorkItemId; // ref to proj.* item
  parentId?: WorkItemId;
  assignees: SubjectRef[];
  externalRefs: ExternalRef[];
  labels: string[];
  specRefs: string[]; // linked spec IDs (e.g., ["identity-model-spec"])
  branch?: string; // git branch name
  pr?: string; // PR URL or number
  reviewer?: string;
  revision: number; // incremented on review rejection
  blockedBy?: WorkItemId; // required when status=blocked
  deployVerified: boolean;
  // Governance runner locking
  claimedByRun?: string; // run ID holding the lock
  claimedAt?: string; // ISO timestamp
  lastCommand?: string; // last /command that acted on this item
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
};
```

### Query port

```typescript
type WorkQuery = {
  ids?: WorkItemId[];
  types?: string[];
  statuses?: string[];
  assignee?: SubjectRef;
  projectId?: WorkItemId;
  relatedTo?: WorkItemId;
  text?: string;
  limit?: number;
  cursor?: string;
};

interface WorkItemQueryPort {
  get(id: WorkItemId): Promise<WorkItem | null>;
  list(query?: WorkQuery): Promise<{ items: WorkItem[]; nextCursor?: string }>;
  listRelations(id: WorkItemId): Promise<WorkRelation[]>;
}
```

### Command port

```typescript
interface WorkItemCommandPort {
  create(input: {
    type: WorkItem["type"];
    title: string;
    summary?: string;
    outcome?: string;
    specRefs?: string[];
    projectId?: WorkItemId;
    parentId?: WorkItemId;
    labels?: string[];
    assignees?: SubjectRef[];
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  patch(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    expectedRevision: Revision;
    set?: Partial<
      Pick<
        WorkItem,
        | "title"
        | "summary"
        | "outcome"
        | "estimate"
        | "priority"
        | "rank"
        | "specRefs"
        | "labels"
        | "branch"
        | "pr"
        | "reviewer"
      >
    >;
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  // Validates against the state machine in development-lifecycle.md.
  // Throws if the transition is invalid (e.g., needs_triage → done for a task).
  // Increments revision when transitioning from needs_merge → needs_implement.
  transitionStatus(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    expectedRevision: Revision;
    toStatus: WorkItemStatus;
    reason?: string; // required when toStatus=blocked
    blockedBy?: WorkItemId; // required when toStatus=blocked
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  setAssignees(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    expectedRevision: Revision;
    assignees: SubjectRef[];
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  // Relations use canonical direction only (blocks, parent_of, relates_to, duplicates).
  // Inverse queries (blocked_by, child_of) are derived at read time.
  upsertRelation(rel: WorkRelation): Promise<void>;
  removeRelation(rel: {
    fromId: WorkItemId;
    toId: WorkItemId;
    type: RelationType;
  }): Promise<void>;

  upsertExternalRef(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    expectedRevision: Revision;
    ref: ExternalRef;
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  // Governance runner locking — claim/release for concurrent dispatch safety.
  claim(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    runId: string;
    command: string;
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;

  release(input: {
    id: WorkItemId;
    runId: string; // must match current claimedByRun
  }): Promise<WorkItem>;
}
```

### Markdown adapter v0

- **Location**: `packages/work-items/src/adapters/markdown/` (co-located with port, per `packages/db-client/` pattern)
- **Source of truth**: `work/items/*.md` and `work/projects/*.md`
- **Revision**: SHA-256 of raw frontmatter YAML (not file content — body is documentation, not state)
- **Concurrency**: optimistic — `expectedRevision` checked before write; reject on mismatch
- **ID allocation**: atomic counter via `next-work-id.mjs` logic, called inside `create()`
- **Relations**: stored in frontmatter as `relations: [{to: "task.0042", type: "blocks"}]`
- **External refs**: stored in frontmatter as `external_refs: [{system: "github", kind: "pull_request", url: "..."}]`
- **Validation**: adapter calls existing validator logic on write (schema enforcement)

## Constraints

- Port interfaces and domain types live in `packages/work-items/src/` — pure, no I/O
- Markdown adapter lives in `packages/work-items/src/adapters/markdown/` — same package, following `packages/db-client/src/adapters/` pattern
- `SubjectRef.userId` must be compatible with `@cogni/ids` `UserId` branded type
- Status transitions must respect `docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md` state machine
- No external PM tool dependency in P0-P2 (OpenProject/Plane are P3 adapters)
- `claimed_by_run` / `claimed_at` locking moves into the port as a first-class concept

## Dependencies

- [x] Identity model spec (`docs/spec/identity-model.md`)
- [x] Development lifecycle spec (`docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md`)
- [x] Existing validator (`scripts/validate-docs-metadata.mjs`)
- [x] Work scanner (`src/lib/work-scanner.ts`)
- [ ] Actor table (story.0117) — P2 dependency for typed agent assignment
- [ ] GitHub webhook infrastructure — P1 dependency for PR auto-linking

## Relationship to Existing Projects

- **Supersedes P3 of `proj.docs-system-infrastructure`** — the Plane/external-tracker integration moves here. The docs-system project keeps P0-P2 (validator, Fumadocs, branch preview).
- **Depends on `story.0117` (actor billing model)** — P2 agent dispatch needs actor_id for assignment. P0-P1 can use string-based SubjectRef without the DB table.
- **Feeds `proj.development-workflows`** — the governance runner dispatch loop becomes a port consumer.

## As-Built Specs

- [Work Items Port](../../docs/spec/work-items-port.md) — port interfaces, domain types, transition rules, adapter contract

## Design Notes

**Why not DB-first:** The markdown system works. 164 work items, CI-validated, git-tracked diffs. The pain is programmatic access, not storage. A port in front of markdown gives us structured access now and adapter-swappability later without a migration.

**Why command/query separation:** The reviewer is right — `update(id, patch)` is too blunt. `transitionStatus` can enforce the state machine. `setAssignees` can validate SubjectRef kinds. `upsertExternalRef` can normalize URLs. Commands carry invariants; patches don't.

**Why not OpenProject now:** OpenProject is a full Rails monolith (PostgreSQL + Redis + memcached + background workers). The integration tax exceeds the value at 1-2 active contributors. The port design makes it a future adapter without commitments now.

**SubjectRef vs ActorId:** P0 uses `SubjectRef` (kind + string ID) because the `actors` table doesn't exist yet. When story.0117 lands, `SubjectRef` resolves to `actor_id` FK. The port contract doesn't change — only the adapter's resolution logic.

**Frontmatter evolution:** Relations and external_refs are new structured frontmatter fields. The validator needs updating to accept them. Existing items without these fields are valid (empty defaults).

**No `fields` bag:** Every frontmatter field with defined semantics (`branch`, `pr`, `revision`, `blocked_by`, `deploy_verified`, `claimed_by_run`, etc.) is modeled as a typed property on `WorkItem`. There is no `Record<string, unknown>` escape hatch — if a field matters, it's in the type. Unknown frontmatter keys are preserved by the markdown adapter on write (round-trip safety) but not exposed through the port.

**Canonical relation direction:** Store only `blocks`, `parent_of`, `relates_to`, `duplicates`. Derive `blocked_by`, `child_of` at query time by reversing `fromId`/`toId`. This avoids double-storage, consistency drift, and halves the relation write surface. The existing `blocked_by` CSV in frontmatter maps to a `blocks` relation stored on the blocking item.

**SubjectRef vs AttributionClaimant:** `SubjectRef` (assignment) and `AttributionClaimant` (credit) are separate concerns with similar shapes. `SubjectRef` models who is working on an item; `AttributionClaimant` models who earned credit. They may converge when the `actors` table unifies identity, but forcing convergence now would couple work management to the attribution pipeline. Keep separate, document the parallel.

**Port + adapter co-location:** Port interfaces and the markdown adapter live in the same `packages/work-items/` package, following the `packages/db-client/src/adapters/` pattern. Port types in `src/`, adapter in `src/adapters/markdown/`. Future adapters (DB, OpenProject) will live in separate packages that depend on `@cogni/work-items` for the port interfaces — same pattern as `packages/db-client/` being the single adapter package today.

**Cursor pagination:** The `WorkQuery.cursor` field exists in the interface for future adapters (DB, OpenProject). The markdown adapter ignores it and returns all matching items — documenting this explicitly. No cursor logic is built for v0.

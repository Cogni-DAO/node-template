# Transparent Credit Payouts — Weekly Activity Pipeline

## Goal

Build a transparent activity-to-payout pipeline. Every week the system collects contribution activity from configured sources (GitHub, Discord), attributes events to contributors, proposes a credit distribution using a weight policy, and lets an admin finalize the result. Payouts are deterministic and recomputable from stored data.

The system makes **what happened** (activity), **how it was valued** (weights), and **who got paid** (allocations) fully transparent and auditable. Valuation weights are explicit and governable — not hidden in an algorithm.

## Supersedes

**proj.sourcecred-onchain** (now Dropped) — Activity-ingestion pipeline replaces SourceCred's algorithmic grain→CSV→Safe pipeline. SourceCred continues running until migration completes. Existing SourceCred specs ([sourcecred.md](../../docs/spec/sourcecred.md), [sourcecred-config-rationale.md](../../docs/spec/sourcecred-config-rationale.md)) remain valid as-built docs.

### Why not extend SourceCred?

1. **Opaque**: Can't point to a specific activity that produced a specific score
2. **Not portable**: Grain is internal state, not auditable data
3. **Fake objectivity**: Algorithmic scoring pretends to be fair while hiding assumptions
4. **Not composable**: Doesn't align with VC/DID standards

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Ship the Activity Pipeline

**Goal:** Automated weekly activity collection from GitHub + Discord, best-effort attribution, admin-finalized credit distribution. Anyone can recompute payouts from stored data.

**V0 user story:**

1. Temporal cron opens a weekly epoch (`period_start` → `period_end`) with weight config
2. `CollectEpochWorkflow` runs GitHub + Discord adapters for the time window
3. Adapters normalize activity → `activity_events` (idempotent by deterministic ID)
4. System resolves platform identities → `user_id` via `user_bindings` (best-effort)
5. Weight policy computes `proposed_units` per contributor → `epoch_allocations`
6. Admin reviews allocations, adjusts `final_units` where needed
7. Admin records pool components (`base_issuance` at minimum)
8. Admin triggers finalize → `computePayouts(final_units, pool_total)` → `payout_statement`
9. Anyone can recompute payouts from stored `activity_events` + pool + weight config

**Definition of done:**

- [ ] Weekly epoch collects GitHub PRs/reviews and Discord messages automatically
- [ ] Activity attributed to contributors via identity bindings (unresolved events flagged)
- [ ] Admin can review and adjust proposed allocations before finalizing
- [ ] A third party can recompute the payout table from stored data exactly
- [ ] Duplicate activity collection is idempotent (deterministic event IDs)
- [ ] Epoch close is idempotent (closing twice yields identical statement hash)
- [ ] All write operations execute in Temporal workflows (Next.js stateless)
- [ ] All math is BIGINT — no floating point, including weight values (milli-units)

### Walk (P1) — Signed Receipts + UI + More Sources

**Goal:** Per-receipt wallet signatures for cryptographic audit trail. UI surfaces. Additional activity sources.

### Run (P2+) — Federation + SourceCred Removal

**Goal:** Receipts as portable VCs. SourceCred removed. Cross-org verification.

## Architecture & Schema

See [epoch-ledger spec](../../docs/spec/epoch-ledger.md) for full architecture, schema, invariants, API contracts, and Temporal workflows.

## Constraints

- Activity weights are transparent and governable — system never hides valuation logic
- Weight config pinned per epoch (stored in epoch row) — reproducible
- Activity events are immutable facts — append-only with DB triggers
- Pool components are pre-recorded during epoch — finalize reads them, never creates budget
- Each pool component type appears at most once per epoch (POOL_UNIQUE_PER_TYPE)
- At least one `base_issuance` pool component required before epoch finalize
- Epoch close is idempotent — same inputs produce identical statement hash
- All write operations go through Temporal — Next.js stays stateless
- All monetary math in BIGINT — no floating point, including weights (integer milli-units)
- `user_id` (UUID) is the canonical identity for all attribution — see [identity spec](../../docs/spec/decentralized-identity.md)
- Identity resolution is best-effort — unresolved events flagged, not silently dropped
- Source adapters use cursor-based incremental sync — no full-window rescans
- Verification = recompute from stored data — not re-fetch from external sources

## Biggest Risk

If the weight policy becomes a black box (complex formulas, hidden multipliers, auto-adjusted weights), you recreate SourceCred's core problem with nicer plumbing. Weights should be simple, explicit, and governable. Admin override exists precisely because no formula perfectly captures contribution value.

## Dependencies

- [x] spike.0082 — design doc landed
- [x] Existing governance approval flow stable (task.0054 — Done)
- [x] Temporal + scheduler-worker service operational
- [x] SIWE wallet auth operational
- [ ] task.0089 — Identity bindings (user_bindings table)
- [ ] GitHub API token configured
- [ ] Discord bot token configured (already exists via OpenClaw)

## Design Notes

### Key reframes

**From spike.0082:** spike.0082 designed a "deterministic distribution engine" with algorithmic valuation. This project corrects the model: weights propose, humans finalize.

**From receipt-signing model:** The original P0 designed per-receipt wallet-signed receipts with SIWE-gated multi-role authorization. This revision moves wallet signing to P1 and replaces manual receipt creation with automated activity ingestion. The core payout math (`computePayouts`, BIGINT, largest-remainder) is unchanged.

| Auth (V0)      | SIWE + simple admin check                            | Minimal — multi-role deferred to P1               |

| Allocation     | `epoch_allocations` with proposed + final units      | Admin adjusts totals, not per-event               |
| Epoch trigger  | Temporal cron (weekly) + manual collect option       | Automated with admin override                     |

| Identity       | user_bindings table (task.0089)                      | Cross-platform identity resolution                |
| GitHub client  | `@octokit/graphql` + `@octokit/webhooks-types`       | Official, typed, maintained by GitHub             |
| Discord client | `discord.js`                                         | Only serious Discord library for Node.js          |
| Verification   | Recompute from stored data only                      | External sources may be private/non-deterministic |

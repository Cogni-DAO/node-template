# Reliability & Uptime

## Goal

Cogni never goes down silently again. If the app hangs, it auto-recovers. If it's down, we know within 60 seconds.

## Context

Feb 7–8, 2026: Two multi-hour outages across production and preview with zero alerting. The app was "healthy but hung" — Docker health checks passed, but the event loop was blocked by OTel `spawnSync` calls to AWS EC2 metadata (169.254.169.254). No watchdog, no external monitor, no alerts. See [postmortem](../../docs/postmortems/2026-02-07-production-vm-loss.md).

## Roadmap

### P0 — Stop the Bleeding

| Deliverable                                                                                                      | Status           | Est |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| Deploy disk cleanup: prune before pulls, dual gate (15GB free / 70% used), remove keep-last tag                  | Done (bug.0015)  | 2   |
| VM watchdog: HEALTHCHECK on `/livez` + autoheal sidecar auto-restarts unhealthy app container (~60-90s recovery) | Todo (task.0014) | 2   |
| OTel fix: set `OTEL_NODE_RESOURCE_DETECTORS=none` in production env                                              | Not Started      | 1   |
| OTel fix: add `resourceDetectors: []` to `NodeSDK` constructor in `src/instrumentation.ts`                       | Not Started      | 1   |
| External uptime monitor (UptimeRobot/Checkly) on `https://cognidao.org/api/meta/readyz`, alerts to Slack/email   | Not Started      | 1   |

### P1 — Don't Lose Data Again

| Deliverable                                                                           | Status      | Est |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| Automated Postgres backups: `pg_dump` to object storage (S3/R2) on cron               | Not Started | 2   |
| Grafana alert: app log silence >5 min (dead-man's switch)                             | Not Started | 1   |
| Grafana alert: container restart count delta >0 / unhealthy >60s / RSS >85% mem_limit | Not Started | 1   |
| Grafana alert: stderr volume spike                                                    | Not Started | 1   |
| Session invalidation on DB reset (prevent stale-session FK errors)                    | Not Started | 1   |

### P2 — Harden the Platform

| Deliverable                                                               | Status      | Est |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| Upgrade VM from 2GB shared to 4GB+ dedicated                              | Not Started | 1   |
| Container memory limits (`mem_limit`) on all services                     | Not Started | 1   |
| Deploy-to-healthy gate: poll `/readyz` after deploy, fail CI if unhealthy | Not Started | 1   |

## Constraints

- VM is CherryServers 2GB shared — watchdog sidecar must be lightweight (~5MB autoheal container)
- OTel SDK is only used for trace ID generation (no exporter) — disabling detectors has zero cost

## Dependencies

- [ ] SSH access to production VM (for watchdog install)
- [ ] Grafana Cloud account (for alert rules)

## As-Built Specs

- [vm-watchdog.md](../../docs/spec/vm-watchdog.md) — HEALTHCHECK + autoheal sidecar design, invariants
- [observability.md](../../docs/spec/observability.md) — structured logging, tracing
- [observability-requirements.md](../../docs/spec/observability-requirements.md) — silent death detection invariants

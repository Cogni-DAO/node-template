# Agentic Interoperability — MCP Server, Agent Identity, A2A Discovery

> Source: [docs/research/agentic-internet-gap-analysis.md](../../docs/research/agentic-internet-gap-analysis.md)

## Goal

Make Cogni agents first-class participants in the agentic internet. Today, our agents are only reachable through the web UI and Discord. The industry has converged on MCP (agent↔tools), A2A (agent↔agent), and OAuth 2.1 as the interoperability stack. This project delivers the protocol surface to participate.

**Non-goals:**

- x402 payment integration (x402 doesn't support streaming token billing — our primary cost center; evaluate when protocol matures)
- Autonomous decision-making (stays in `proj.governance-agents`)
- General container hosting (MCP scope: approved server templates only, not a Heroku clone)

## Context

As of Feb 2026, the agentic internet is crystallizing around:

- **MCP**: 97M monthly SDK downloads, 10K+ servers, first-class in ChatGPT/Claude/Cursor/Gemini/Copilot/VS Code
- **A2A**: Google's agent-to-agent protocol under Linux Foundation, uses "agent cards" for discovery
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE**: MCP Authorization Spec standard for resource access
- **NIST**: AI Agent Standards Initiative (Feb 17), Identity & Authorization paper (Feb 5)

We have: hexagonal architecture (57 boundary tests), tool catalog with 6 tools, `AgentCatalogPort` (discovery P0 done), identity bindings, execution grants. We lack: MCP server (stub only), agent OAuth, A2A compatibility, external tool consumption.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0): MCP Server — Become Addressable

**Goal:** Expose Cogni tools via MCP so external agents and clients can discover and invoke them.

**Prerequisite:** `proj.tool-use-evolution` P0 is mostly Done (semantic types, tool policy, ToolSourcePort). Remaining P0 items (connection auth, RBAC wiring) are parallel, not blocking.

| MCP `tools/list` endpoint returns all enabled tools                                    | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| MCP `tools/call` delegates to `toolRunner.exec()` (reuses existing policy pipeline)    | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Transport: stdio for local dev, SSE/streamable-HTTP for remote                         | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| MCP tool ID format: `mcp:cogni:<toolName>` (namespaced per `proj.tool-use-evolution`)  | Not Started | 0   | —         |
| Integration test: external MCP client discovers and calls `get-current-time`           | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| `tools/list_changed` notification when catalog changes                                 | Not Started | 1   | —         |

**API Key Auth (P0.0) — Credential Resolver + App Keys:**

Credential resolver pattern (GitHub/Vercel standard). `resolveRequestIdentity()` checks Bearer key first, falls back to session cookie. Keys bind to `user_id` → `billing_account_id`. Accelerates proj.accounts-api-keys P3.

| Deliverable                                                                               | Status           | Est | Work Item |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --- | --------- |
| `app_api_keys` table + credential resolver + wire into completions route                  | needs_implement  | 2   | task.0300 |

**Pruned from v0 (tracked for P1+):**
- Agent/service principal identity (scoped machine identities separate from user PATs) — requires actors table
- Agent self-provisioning of API keys — requires actor_id + delegation model
- Per-key rate limiting — premature while OpenRouter handles free-tier limits globally
- Async-first run model (create-run → run-id → stream → fetch) — already Temporal-backed, needs API surface

**OAuth 2.1 Auth (P0.1) — MCP Resource Access:**

| Deliverable                                                                     | Status      | Est | Work Item |

| Map OAuth token → `ActorId` for `ToolInvocationContext`                         | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Rate limiting per authenticated client                                          | Not Started | 1   | —         |
| Deny unauthenticated access by default (align with MCP security audit findings) | Not Started | 0   | —         |
| Test: unauthenticated client gets 401, not tool list                            | Not Started | 1   | —         |

### Run (P2): Cross-Agent Delegation — Become Collaborative

**Goal:** Agents delegate work to each other across system boundaries.

**Depends on:** `proj.governance-agents` P0 (signal infra), `proj.thread-persistence` P1 (durable state), `proj.hil-graphs` P0 (approval gates)

| Deliverable                                                                                        | Status      | Est | Work Item |

## Constraints

- **MCP_SERVER_AUTH_REQUIRED** — All MCP endpoints require OAuth authentication. No anonymous tool access (learned from Feb 21 audit: 41% of MCP servers lack auth).
- **MCP_UNTRUSTED_BY_DEFAULT** — External MCP tools not auto-enabled on discovery (from `proj.tool-use-evolution`).
- **AGENT_IDENTITY_REQUIRED** — All outbound agent actions carry verifiable identity via OAuth token with `ActorId`.
- **HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED_MVP** — Cross-agent delegation and autonomous spending require human approval initially.
- **REUSE_TOOL_PIPELINE** — MCP `tools/call` delegates to existing `toolRunner.exec()`. No parallel execution path.
- **NO_X402_YET** — x402 does not support streaming token billing (our primary cost). Evaluate when protocol matures for dynamic-amount use cases.

## Design Notes

### Architectural Decisions (from design review, 2026-04-06)

**Decision 1: One canonical machine surface, not bespoke agent endpoints.**
Agents hit the same `/api/v1/chat/completions` as browser users. No `/api/v1/agent/*` namespace. The product surface is the API; the UI is one client of it.

**Decision 2: MCP for tools/context, A2A only for remote federation.**
MCP is the tool/context standard (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). A2A is for when Cogni must behave as a remote specialist agent called by other agents. MCP first (P0), A2A only at P2 when federation is real.

**Decision 3: Credential resolver, not wrapper modes.**
Auth resolution uses a `resolveRequestIdentity()` function passed as the `getSessionUser` callback — the standard GitHub/Vercel pattern. The wrapper never knows about API keys. This is how top 0.1% teams do it.

**Decision 4: Identity split — user keys now, machine principals later.**
Start with user-bound app keys (user_id FK). Long-lived autonomous agents graduate to scoped machine identities (actor_id) when the actors table lands — same way GitHub recommends Apps over user PATs for automation.

### Prior Notes

**Why a separate project (not just accelerating `proj.tool-use-evolution` P2)?**

The MCP server is the nucleus, but the interoperability story spans identity (agent-registry), auth (rbac-hardening, tenant-connections), discovery (A2A agent cards), and delegation (governance-agents, hil-graphs). No single existing project owns this cross-cutting concern. This project coordinates the interop surface while each domain project retains ownership of its internals.

**P0 is intentionally narrow:** implement the MCP server + auth. This makes our agents addressable with minimal new code — the tool catalog, policy system, and toolRunner pipeline already exist. The MCP server is a thin adapter over existing infrastructure, which is exactly what hexagonal architecture enables.

**x402 is deliberately excluded.** The protocol is designed for pay-per-request (HTTP 402 → USDC → access). Our primary billing use case is streaming LLM inference with dynamic token costs, which x402 doesn't address. Our existing LiteLLM proxy audit → `charge_receipts` pipeline is the correct pattern for AI costs. We'll revisit x402 when it supports streaming/metered billing, or for non-streaming tool gating (data APIs, static resources) at P1+.

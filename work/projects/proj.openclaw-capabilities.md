# OpenClaw Capabilities Integration

> Relationship to [proj.sandboxed-agents](proj.sandboxed-agents.md): that project owns the **container sandbox layer** (Docker isolation, socket bridge, proxy plumbing, `SandboxRunnerPort`). This project owns everything **above** that layer: gateway protocol client, agent catalog wiring, UI integration, git relay, multi-agent routing, and OpenClaw-specific capabilities.

## Goal

Make OpenClaw a fully integrated, production-quality agent runtime within Cogni. Users select OpenClaw agents from the chat UI, messages flow through the gateway protocol, responses stream back with billing, and code-producing agents can create PRs via host-side git relay — all without OpenClaw's own UI or any credential leakage into containers.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Gateway Chat E2E

**Goal:** OpenClaw agent is selectable in the Cogni UI and produces real chat responses with accurate billing. The gateway WS client correctly implements the full protocol lifecycle.

#### Gateway Client

The production WS client must implement the OpenClaw gateway protocol correctly. Reference implementation: `openclaw/src/gateway/client.ts` (upstream).

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------- |
| Gateway client `runAgent()` generator — correct ACK → deltas → final res lifecycle        | In Progress | 3   | task.0008 |
| `extractTextFromResult()` — extract content from authoritative `result.payloads`          | In Progress | 1   | task.0008 |
| `configureSession()` — per-session outboundHeaders + model override via `sessions.patch`  | Done        | 1   | task.0010 |
| Stack test: gateway WS chat returns real content (not ACK JSON)                           | In Progress | 1   | task.0008 |
| Stack test: billing entries in proxy audit log after gateway call                         | In Progress | 1   | task.0008 |
| Stack test: LITELLM_MASTER_KEY not in gateway container env                               | Done        | 1   | —         |
| **Blocker:** OpenClaw v2026.2.4 agent returns empty payloads (content silently discarded) | In Progress | 1   | bug.0009  |

**Protocol state machine (from upstream `client.ts` `expectFinal` semantics):**

```
handshake: challenge → connect(auth) → hello-ok
agent call: req(agent) → ACK res(accepted) → chat delta events (0–N)
            → chat final signal (NOT terminal) → final "ok" res with result.payloads (terminal)
```

#### Gateway Service Operations

The gateway is a long-running service (externally-built image, compose-managed). It needs the same operational rigor as any other service: CI builds, model catalog, documentation, root scripts. This is a new pattern — **external image service** — not covered by the current `create-service.md` guide.

| Root script `sandbox:openclaw:docker:build` for unified image (parity with `sandbox:docker:build`)                                                                              | Not Started | 0.5 | task.0031 |
| CI: pull `openclaw-outbound-headers:latest` from GHCR + start gateway profile in stack-test compose `up`                                                                        | Done        | 1   | —         |
| Gateway stack tests (`sandbox-openclaw.stack.test.ts`) pass in CI — gateway image pulled, profile started                                                                       | Done        | 1   | —         |
| Deploy: `deploy.sh` pulls gateway image from GHCR + starts `--profile sandbox-openclaw` on preview/prod VMs                                                                     | Done        | 1   | —         |

| Parameterize gateway auth token — replace hardcoded `openclaw-internal-token` with generated secret per environment                                                             | Todo        | 1   | task.0019 |
| Update `services/sandbox-openclaw/AGENTS.md` — document gateway mode, compose services, config, proxy                                                                           | Not Started | 0.5 | (create)  |

| Gateway agent workspace + SOUL.md — dedicated workspace with chat-appropriate AGENTS.md, upstream heartbeat prompt fix                                                          | Todo        | 2   | task.0023 |

**Key distinction**: `openclaw-gateway` uses `openclaw-outbound-headers:latest` (built in the OpenClaw repo, published to GHCR). We don't own that Dockerfile — we configure it via bind-mounted `openclaw-gateway.json` and deploy via compose. `cogni-sandbox-openclaw` (ephemeral) is the image we DO build from `services/sandbox-openclaw/Dockerfile`. Both need CI coverage.

#### Agent Catalog + UI Wiring

| Deliverable                                                                       | Status | Est | Work Item |

| Bootstrap wiring: `LazySandboxGraphProvider` with gateway client + billing reader | Done   | 1   | —         |

### Walk (P1) — Git Relay + Dynamic Catalog + Gateway Hardening

**Goal:** Code-producing agents create PRs via host-side git relay. UI discovers agents from API. Gateway client is production-grade.

**North star:** Credentials never enter the agent runtime; host owns push+PR forever.

#### Git Relay — MVP

Per [sandbox-git-write-permissions.md](../../docs/research/sandbox-git-write-permissions.md) Option A and [openclaw-sandbox-controls.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-controls.md) HOST_SIDE_GIT_RELAY.

The real requirement is per-run RW workspace + unique branch. Not blocked on "ephemeral-only" — use whichever execution path is easiest today. Multiple concurrent coder runs allowed (footgun accepted for now). Enforce: unique workspace per runId + unique branch per runId.

| Deliverable                                                                                                                                              | Status      | Est | Work Item |

#### Git Relay — Robustness

| Deliverable                                                                                                                         | Status      | Est |

#### Dynamic Agent Catalog

Per [openclaw-sandbox-controls.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-controls.md) CATALOG_FROM_API:

#### Gateway Client Hardening

Model after upstream `openclaw/src/gateway/client.ts` features:

| Deliverable                                                                                        | Status      | Est |

| [ ] Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (upstream `scheduleReconnect`, lines 349-360)          | Not Started | 2   |
| [ ] Tick-based liveness detection (upstream `startTickWatch`, lines 369-386)                       | Not Started | 1   |

**Features from upstream we do NOT need:** device identity/keypair signing, TLS fingerprint pinning, device auth token store/rotate (all server-to-server token auth is sufficient).

### Run (P2+) — Credential Evolution, Warm Pool, Multi-Agent

**Goal:** Production-grade credential management, container warm pool for fast cold starts, full OpenClaw capability surface.

#### Credential Evolution + Advanced Git

Per [openclaw-sandbox-controls.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-controls.md) ENV_CREDENTIALS_FIRST:

| Deliverable                                                                                                                 | Status      | Est |

| [ ] Gateway per-session workspace — only if use cases emerge requiring real-time code editing in shared gateway             | Not Started | 3   |

#### Warm Pool (Container Cold-Start Elimination)

A pool of pre-warmed coding-agent containers ready to accept jobs, eliminating clone + container-start latency.

| Deliverable                                                                                                                        | Status      | Est |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- |
| [ ] Pool manager: assigns one job to one worker, unique workspace per job, no state bleed between jobs                             | Not Started | 3   |
| [ ] Workers rebound to per-job workspace — if OpenClaw supports workspace override, use it; else one-job-per-worker + symlink flip | Not Started | 2   |
| [ ] Periodic worker restart to prevent state accumulation                                                                          | Not Started | 1   |

Host still owns push+PR in warm pool mode — workers never need GitHub credentials.

#### Multi-Agent + Custom Agents

## Constraints

- **North star: credentials never enter the agent runtime; host owns push+PR forever** — this holds across all phases, including warm pool
- All credential-bearing operations on host, never in sandbox or gateway container (links to SECRETS_HOST_ONLY, HOST_SIDE_GIT_RELAY in specs)
- Git relay is execution-mode-agnostic — the requirement is per-run RW workspace + unique branch, not "must be ephemeral"
- Chat UI fetches agent list from API — no hardcoded arrays long-term (links to CATALOG_FROM_API)
- Dashboard and controls are Cogni-native Next.js — no OpenClaw Lit UI (links to COGNI_NATIVE_UI)
- Gateway client must not block on upstream OpenClaw package — our client implements the protocol directly, using upstream as reference only
- P1 uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var; `ConnectionBroker` deferred to P2

## Dependencies

- [x] Sandbox container infrastructure operational (proj.sandboxed-agents P0–P0.75)
- [x] OpenClaw gateway + proxy containers running (`docker compose` services)
- [x] Agent catalog API: `GET /api/v1/ai/agents` (existing)
- [x] Billing pipeline: proxy audit log → `ProxyBillingReader` → `usage_report` → `charge_receipts`
- [ ] `GITHUB_TOKEN` provisioning for P1 git relay
- [ ] `ConnectionBroker` for P2 credential evolution (proj.tenant-connections)

## As-Built Specs

- [openclaw-sandbox-spec.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-spec.md) — Invariants 13-19: container image, LLM protocol, I/O protocol, billing
- [sandboxed-agents.md](../../docs/spec/sandboxed-agents.md) — Invariants 1-12: core sandbox architecture, socket bridge
- [streaming-status.md](../../docs/spec/streaming-status.md) — StatusEvent pipeline: OpenClaw agent events → AiEvent → transient data-status SSE chunks

## Design Notes

### Gateway Client: Build vs Reuse

**Upstream** (`openclaw/src/gateway/client.ts`, ~440 lines):

- Persistent connection with reconnect + backoff
- `request<T>(method, params, { expectFinal })` — generic req/res correlation
- `expectFinal` skips ACK (status=accepted), waits for real terminal response
- Tick-based liveness detection (2× tick interval → close + reconnect)
- Heavily coupled to OpenClaw internals: device identity signing, TLS fingerprint pinning, AJV validators

**Our client** (`src/adapters/server/sandbox/openclaw-gateway-client.ts`, ~500 lines):

- One WS per call (P0), should become persistent (P1)
- `runAgent()` AsyncGenerator yields typed events: accepted, text_delta, chat_final, chat_error
- Correct protocol lifecycle as of unstaged changes (ACK → deltas → chat final signal → final "ok" res)
- No device auth, no TLS pinning needed (server-to-server, localhost/docker-internal)

**Decision:** Build our own, modeled on upstream's `pending` map + `expectFinal` + reconnect patterns. Upstream is not consumable as a library (deeply coupled internals, not exported from package). P0 ships the generator pattern; P1 refactors to persistent connection.

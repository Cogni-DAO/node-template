# Graph Execution — Transport/Enforcement Split & Contract Tests

> Source: docs/GRAPH_EXECUTOR_AUDIT.md (roadmap content extracted during docs migration)

## Goal

Refactor the graph execution system to centralize billing enforcement in a core wrapper, push transport-only concerns into adapters, add a shared contract test suite for all executor implementations, and close remaining P0/P1 TODO items from the architecture audit.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Close Audit TODOs

**Goal:** Resolve open audit findings before structural refactoring.

| Deliverable                                          | Status      | Est | Work Item |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------- |
| TODO #4b: Persist graphId to charge_receipts DB      | Not Started | 2   | —         |
| TODO #5: Contract tests for executor implementations | Not Started | 3   | —         |
| TODO #7: Remove legacy `recordBilling()` function    | Not Started | 1   | —         |

**TODO #4b — Persist graphId to charge_receipts DB:**

`graphId` is on `UsageFact` and validated via Zod schemas, but not yet persisted to the DB. Requires:

- Add `graphId` column to `charge_receipts` table (`packages/db-schema/src/billing.ts`)
- Add `graphId` to `ChargeReceiptParams` (`src/ports/accounts.port.ts`)
- Pass `fact.graphId` through `commitUsageFact()` → `recordChargeReceipt()` (`billing.ts`, `drizzle.adapter.ts`)
- DB migration
- Stack test: assert `graphId` appears in `charge_receipts` row after completion
- Verify `graphId` does NOT affect idempotency key (key remains `runId/attempt/usageUnitId`)

**TODO #5 — Contract Tests for Executor Implementations:**

No shared contract test suite validates executor implementations against billing/streaming invariants. Each test should be a standalone file under `tests/contract/`.

Required coverage:

- **UsageFact Zod schemas**: strict accepts valid inproc/sandbox facts, rejects missing `usageUnitId`, rejects non-namespaced `graphId`; hints accepts missing `usageUnitId`, rejects wrong `executorType`
- **RunEventRelay validation**: billing-authoritative invalid fact → hard failure (error in stream); external invalid fact → soft warning (billing skipped); `isTerminated` guard → events after done ignored; valid fact → `commitUsageFact` called
- **Executor graphId propagation**: `usage_report` events from inproc/sandbox contain correct `graphId`
- **Event stream ordering**: content → usage_report → assistant_final → done (exactly one done)

**TODO #7 — Remove Legacy `recordBilling()` Function:**

`billing.ts:recordBilling()` is the pre-graph direct billing path. Marked for removal once all execution flows through `commitUsageFact()`. Still has its own `MISSING:` fallback logic that contradicts the strict-fail policy.

### Walk (P1) — Unify Context Envelopes

**Goal:** Standardize context shapes across the executor call chain.

| Deliverable                                           | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| TODO #6: Unify CompletionRunContext shapes            | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |
| TODO #8: Research stable context envelope unification | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |

**TODO #6 — Unify CompletionRunContext Shapes:**

`executeCompletionUnit` receives `{runId, attempt, ingressRequestId, graphId}` but `createCompletionUnitStream` receives `{runId, attempt, caller, graphId}` — inconsistent context envelope shapes throughout the call chain. Define a single `CompletionRunContext` type.

**TODO #8 — Research Stable Context Envelope Unification:**

Audit all context envelope shapes across the call chain (`RunContext`, `CompletionUnitParams.runContext`, `createCompletionUnitStream`'s inline type) and determine whether a single `CompletionRunContext` type can replace them. Consider whether `caller` (which carries `billingAccountId`/`virtualKeyId`) should be part of the context or passed separately. Check if `RunContext` from `@cogni/ai-core` can be extended rather than defining a new type.

### Run (P2) — Transport/Enforcement Split

**Goal:** Full structural refactoring of the graph executor architecture.

| Deliverable                                                | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

```

**Concrete Refactor Moves:**

Move OUT of Adapters → INTO Core Wrapper:

1. **Billing policy decisions** (`canSpend`, budget checks, attribution rules)
2. **Receipt/ledger writes** (all `accountService.recordChargeReceipt` call sites)
3. **Canonical event mapping** (normalize adapter-specific events to AiEvent schema)
4. **Idempotency key generation** (shared `computeIdempotencyKey` validator)

Move INTO Transport Adapters ONLY:

1. **Provider-specific execution logic** (LangGraph server calls, sandbox plumbing, OpenClaw interaction)
2. **Provider-specific parsing** (raw SDK responses → canonical events + usageFacts)

Introduce NEW Components:

1. **BillingReconciler Service** — Consumes `usageFacts[]` from transports, produces charge receipts idempotently, shared by all executors, handles both immediate (in-proc) and deferred (external polling) strategies

2. **Shared Contract Test Suite** (`tests/contract/graph-executors/transport-contract.test.ts`) — Validates every transport against: event stream shape, cancellation semantics, idempotency, usage facts schema, billing side effects prohibition

**Mechanical Enforcement:**

Dependency Cruiser rules (`no-adapter-imports-in-core`, `no-db-client-in-adapters`, `no-billing-writes-in-adapters`, `executors-via-port-only`) and ESLint restricted imports to enforce the transport/enforcement split at build time.

### Validation Plan

**Pre-Refactor Baseline:**

1. Capture current behavior: `pnpm test:stack:docker`, `pnpm check:full`
2. Document current violations: files violating future dependency rules, executors without contract tests

**Post-Refactor Proofs:**

| Invariant           | Proof Command                                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ONE_LEDGER_WRITER   | `git grep -r 'recordChargeReceipt' src/` → only billing.ts             |
| IDEMPOTENT_CHARGES  | `pnpm test:stack -- billing-idempotency`                               |
| SCHEMA_VALIDATION   | Inject malformed UsageFact → Zod error before billing                  |
| Contract Compliance | `pnpm test:contract -- graph-executors` → all transports pass          |
| Billing Coverage    | `pnpm test:stack -- streaming-side-effects` → all executor types write |

**Inline vs Reconciliation Strategy:**

- **Inline Billing** (P0: InProc, Sandbox): Trusted component captures `provider_call_id` + usage inline per LLM call. Commits per-call UsageFacts during execution.
- **Reconciliation Billing** (P1: External LangGraph Server): External executor outside trusted boundary. Query `/spend/logs` after stream completes. Server-controlled identity + metadata ensure correctness.

#### P1: Node-Keyed Model & Tool Configuration

Per-node model/tool overrides via flat configurable keys: `<nodeKey>__model`, `<nodeKey>__toolIds`. Resolution: override ?? default.

**File Pointers (planned changes):**

| File                                                                | Change                                                     |

### Run (P2+) — External Adapters

**Goal:** Add external execution adapters for Claude Agent SDK, n8n, and future engines.

| Deliverable                                                                                   | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Claude Agent SDK Adapter (see [ini.claude-sdk-adapter.md](ini.claude-sdk-adapter.md))         | Not Started | 5   | (create at P2 start) |
| n8n Workflow Adapter (see [ini.n8n-integration.md](ini.n8n-integration.md))                   | Not Started | 5   | (create at P2 start) |
| OpenClaw/Clawdbot Adapter (superseded by ini.sandboxed-agents.md; original: Clawdbot/Moltbot) | Superseded  | —   | —                    |
| Future external adapters (Flowise/custom) — build only if demand materializes                 | Not Started | —   | (create if needed)   |

**P2 Adapter Checklists (from source):**

**Claude Agent SDK:**

- [ ] Create `ClaudeAgentExecutor` implementing `GraphExecutorPort`
- [ ] Map SDK `SDKMessage` stream → `AiEvent` stream
- [ ] Bridge tools via in-process MCP server (`createSdkMcpServer`)
- [ ] Emit `usage_report` with `session_id`-based `usageUnitId`
- [ ] Add `anthropic_sdk` to `SOURCE_SYSTEMS` enum

**n8n Workflow:**

- [ ] Create `N8nWorkflowExecutor` implementing `GraphExecutorPort`
- [ ] Invoke n8n workflows via webhook POST
- [ ] Support sync response mode (wait for completion)
- [ ] Reconcile billing via LiteLLM spend logs (LLM routed through gateway)
- [ ] Emit `usage_report` with `execution_id`-based `usageUnitId`

**Clawdbot/Moltbot (superseded by OpenClaw sandbox integration):**

- [ ] Create `ClawdbotExecutorAdapter` implementing `GraphExecutorPort`
- [ ] Invoke Moltbot Gateway via `/v1/chat/completions` with SSE streaming
- [ ] Route all LLM calls through LiteLLM (DAO billing via virtual key)
- [ ] Containment: sandboxing enabled, elevated disabled, egress allowlist
- [ ] Privileged integrations via Cogni bridge tool (toolRunner.exec)
- [ ] Reconcile billing via LiteLLM spend logs (end_user correlation)

> Note: Clawdbot/Moltbot adapter has been superseded by the OpenClaw sandbox integration. See [openclaw-sandbox-spec.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-spec.md) and [ini.sandboxed-agents.md](ini.sandboxed-agents.md). These checklist items are preserved for NO_DATA_LOSS but should be considered historical.

### Known Issues & Risk Flags

**Known Issues:**

- [ ] `usage_report` only emitted on success; error/abort with partial usage not billed (P1: add optional `usage` to error result)

**LangGraph Server Adapter — Billing Parity Gap (P0 Gated):**

`langgraph_server` executor is internal/experimental only in P0. Cannot be a customer-billable path until it achieves billing-grade `UsageFact` parity.

| Field         | InProc | Server | Notes                                |
| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `usageUnitId` | Yes    | No     | Requires `x-litellm-call-id` capture |
| `costUsd`     | Yes    | No     | Requires `x-litellm-response-cost`   |
| `model`       | Yes    | No     | Requires resolved model from LiteLLM |

**Fix path (if server must be paid in P0):** `langgraph-server` must capture LiteLLM response headers (`call-id`, `response-cost`, `model`, tokens) and emit `usage_report` with `usageUnitId=litellmCallId`. Without this, billing idempotency relies on `callIndex` fallback which is unsafe.

**Risk Flags:**

1. **callIndex fallback is nondeterministic under concurrency/resume** — Must remain error-only path and not become normal operation. If `callIndex` fallback frequency exceeds threshold, investigate root cause.

2. **USAGE_EMIT_ON_FINAL_ONLY implies partial failures are unbilled** — Explicitly accepted for P0. If graph fails mid-execution after N LLM calls, those calls are not billed. Add partial-usage reporting in P1 if revenue leakage is material.

3. **Server path without usageUnitId breaks idempotency** — If server path is exposed to customers without fix, duplicate charges are possible on retry. Gate behind feature flag until resolved.

---

## Constraints

- ONE_LEDGER_WRITER: Only `billing.ts` calls `recordChargeReceipt()`
- IDEMPOTENT_CHARGES: `source_reference` prevents duplicates; key = `${runId}/${attempt}/${usageUnitId}`
- ZERO_CREDIT_RECEIPTS: Always write receipt, even $0
- GRAPH_LLM_VIA_COMPLETION: InProc graphs use completion unit
- BILLING_INDEPENDENT_OF_CLIENT: Pump continues regardless of UI disconnect
- GRAPH_FINALIZATION_ONCE: Exactly one `done` event per run
- USAGE_FACT_VALIDATED: Zod schema at ingestion boundary (strict for inproc/sandbox, hints for external)
- GRAPHID_REQUIRED: `graphId` on UsageFact, typed as GraphId in port
- EXTERNAL_BILLING_VIA_RECONCILIATION: Dev/external providers defer billing to reconciliation

## Dependencies

- [x] GraphExecutorPort (existing)
- [x] UsageFact Zod schemas (existing)
- [x] RunEventRelay billing pipeline (existing)
- [ ] charge_receipts graphId column (TODO #4b)

## As-Built Specs

- [Graph Execution](../../docs/spec/graph-execution.md)

## Design Notes

- Audit report: (deleted, content preserved in this initiative — point-in-time, 2026-02-07)
- GraphProvider is an internal adapter interface, NOT a port — acceptable for current executor count (3)
- ⚠️ BYPASS RISK: No architectural enforcement prevents facades from importing adapters directly (only convention + arch_probes)
- Dev provider emits hints-only UsageFact (no usageUnitId); full reconciliation deferred to P1
- Sandbox billing: header capture, executorType "sandbox", graphId in UsageFact — DB persistence pending

# Human-in-the-Loop Graph Execution

> Source: docs/spec/human-in-the-loop.md

## Goal

Implement the provider-agnostic pause/resume contract for human-in-the-loop (HIL) graph execution. Graph yields control via interrupt; human decision arrives via separate resume request; graph resumes from persisted state.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — First HIL Graph

**Goal:** Minimal end-to-end HIL flow with LangGraph provider.

### Walk (P1) — HIL Polish

**Goal:** Timeout handling, multi-step revision loops, UI components.

| Deliverable                                                               | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

| Add UI components per interrupt `kind` (graph packages may provide)       | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |

### Run (P2+) — Multi-Provider Resume

**Goal:** Validate provider-agnostic contract across 2+ providers.

| Deliverable                                                   | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

| Validate provider-agnostic contract works across 2+ providers | Not Started | 2   | (create at P2 start) |
| **Do NOT build preemptively**                                 | —           | —   | —                    |

## Constraints

- HIL = pause/resume contract — graph yields control; resume uses same `stateKey`
- HTTP request starts graph → returns `needs_input` + `stateKey` + interrupt envelope; resume via separate request
- `stateKey` is the ONLY resumable identifier exposed to UI/API — internal provider refs NEVER leak
- No side effects before human approval (publishing, posting, sending gated)
- All providers resume via `GraphExecutorPort.runGraph({ stateKey, resumeDecision, ... })`
- `interrupt.data` is JSON only, max 256KB; `resumeValue` is JSON only, max 64KB
- At most one resume in-flight per `stateKey` (atomic row lock, 30s expiry)
- `provider_ref` NEVER returned in API responses, logged, or exposed to UI
- ai-core defines only the envelope — graph packages own typed payloads
- `GraphRunOutcome` is a discriminated union — no optional fields creating inconsistent states

## Dependencies

- [ ] PostgresSaver checkpointer (`@langchain/langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`)
- [ ] LangGraph interrupt/Command API stability
- [ ] Claude Agent SDK session resume (for P2)

## As-Built Specs

- [human-in-the-loop.md](../../docs/spec/human-in-the-loop.md) — HIL design invariants, schema, interrupt envelope, resume contract

## Design Notes

### Explicitly Deferred from P0

- UI-specific payload schemas in ai-core (graphs own their types)
- Claude Agent SDK provider (validate LangGraph first)
- Time-travel/forking via checkpoint selection
- Interrupt timeout auto-cleanup job (table has `expires_at`; cleanup job is P1)
- WebSocket push for interrupt notifications
- Branded types (`StateKey`, `InterruptKind`) — use plain strings for P0

**Why:** P0 validates pause/resume contract works with one provider (LangGraph) using the unified routing table. Multi-provider validation in P1+.

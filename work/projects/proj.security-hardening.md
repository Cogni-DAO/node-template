title: Security Hardening — SOC2-Aligned Production Access Controls
state: Active
priority: 3
estimate: 8
summary: Close the SOC2 control gaps exposed by the bug.0403 incident response — direct production SSH + superuser psql + chat-text authorization for financial-data mutations bypassed every meaningful access control. Establish maker-checker, app-mediated operator actions, immutable audit, and short-lived credentials so prod data writes by a single agent become structurally impossible. Tier-1 foundation = External Secrets Operator + OpenBao (OSS Vault fork) as the single secret-truth substrate that Crawl access controls depend on.
outcome: No human or agent can mutate production financial-state data via direct SSH + raw SQL. All operator actions (cap bumps, lifecycle reconciliation, grant edits) flow through authenticated admin endpoints with maker-checker, recorded in an immutable audit log, gated by short-lived signed credentials issued from OpenBao via ESO. Plaintext secrets never live on developer laptops, in GitHub Actions logs, or in agent context — agents reference secrets by name only. SOC2 CC6.1 / CC6.6 / CC8.1 controls have written runbooks with evidence-collection steps.

# Security Hardening — SOC2-Aligned Production Access Controls

## Goal

No human or agent can mutate production financial-state data (`poly_wallet_grants`, `poly_redeem_jobs`, future `operator_*` tables) via direct SSH + raw SQL. Every operator action flows through an authenticated admin endpoint with maker-checker, recorded in an immutable audit log, gated by short-lived signed credentials. SOC2 CC6.1 / CC6.6 / CC8.1 controls have written runbooks with evidence-collection steps that pass an external audit.

## Constraints

- **Don't break the experiment-friendly slot.** `candidate-a` write-mode SSH is intentionally permitted for 5-minute experiments per the `devops-expert` skill rules; this project narrows the prod-only gap, not the candidate-a workflow.
- **Don't reintroduce app-level controls that already exist.** RLS, `app_user`/`app_service` role split, and Zod contract validation are working; this project removes the superuser-shell bypass, not the existing controls.
- **One-developer team reality.** Maker-checker has to be implementable when there's only one human reviewer — the "checker" can be an automated pre-condition (e.g., SHA-pinned chain-truth verification) for low-risk classes, with human-checker reserved for high-risk classes.
- **OSS-first secrets substrate.** Backend choice is OpenBao (Apache-licensed Vault fork, OSS sovereign). No vendor lock to a paid KMS at the baseline. Forks may swap backends via ESO's pluggable provider model; operator-managed multi-tenant KMS (Tier 2) is the future product layer on top, not a requirement of the OSS baseline.
- **Substrate-before-controls ordering.** Crawl rows 2-3 (bastion + named DB role) both require a real secret store to hold the CA private key and the role password without putting them back on disk. Tier-1 (ESO + OpenBao) is therefore Crawl row 0 and gates the rest of the phase.

## Motivating Incident

During bug.0403 response (2026-04-27), one Claude Code agent autonomously:

1. Read the prod VM SSH private key from `.local/production-vm-key` on a developer laptop.
2. Connected to the prod VM as `root` via SSH.
3. Ran `docker exec` to get a `psql -U postgres` superuser shell, **bypassing RLS, app-level RBAC, and the `app_user` role boundaries**.
4. Executed `UPDATE poly_wallet_grants` to bump cap limits on a financial-state table ($4/$30 → $5/$60).
5. Executed `UPDATE poly_redeem_jobs` to reconcile 7 abandoned redemption jobs to `confirmed` — mutating financial settlement state.

Authorization for both writes was a **single chat message** ("Yes, I authorize you to run this") with no out-of-band confirmation, no MFA, no second-party approval, no change ticket, no automated rollback plan. The action was correct and the data was good — but the **control plane allowed any future agent (or compromised laptop) to do exactly the same with no friction**.

This is a structural SOC2 fail, not a policy fail.

## Secrets Substrate (foundation for every Crawl/Walk control)

Current state (verified 2026-05-19): **C-**. GitHub Actions env vars → SSH → `/opt/cogni-template-runtime/.env` plaintext on VM; SOPS scaffold in tree (`infra/k8s/secrets/.sops.yaml`) but its own comment says _"ksops is not yet end-to-end activated, no real age keys exist, no .enc.yaml files exist"_; zero `ExternalSecret` resources; rotation = redeploy.

Target shape — three tiers, all Argo-idiomatic:

```
   ┌─── Tier 0: Bootstrap (cluster doesn't exist yet) ──────────────────────┐
   │   GitHub Actions ─OIDC─▶ OpenBao (short-lived token, no long-lived     │

                                  ▼
   ┌─── Tier 2: Operator-managed multi-tenant KMS (north star) ─────────────┐
   │   Cogni operator app hosts a per-fork KMS namespace. Forks' ESO         │
   │   authenticates with one per-fork token; all other secrets flow         │
   │   operator-UI → KMS → ESO → k8s Secret → pod.                           │
   │                                                                         │
   │   AI-agent-safe: agents reference secrets by NAME, never VALUE.         │
   │   Plaintext never enters agent context / git / GitHub Actions logs.     │
   │   Every access logged to operator's audit stream (Loki tenant).         │
   │   Rotation = control-plane operation, not a redeploy.                   │
   │                                                                         │
   │   Out of scope for this project (node-template baseline). Tracked       │
   │   separately as an operator-app product capability. The Tier-1          │
   │   baseline supports arbitrary ESO backends including a future           │
   │   `OperatorKmsProvider`, so Tier-2 is additive, not replacing.          │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Tier-1 is the Pareto path: closes the laptop-plaintext gap, retires the SOPS scaffold, enables rotation without redeploy, and gives bastion + named-DB-role somewhere to live. Tier-2 is the Cogni-operator-as-a-service layer on top — opt-in for forks that adopt the operator app, not a baseline requirement.

Implementation lives in `task.0284` (Secrets single source of truth — External Secrets Operator + secret store). Backend selection finalized as OpenBao (was open in original task description).

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Stop the bleed

**Goal:** make today's exact failure mode impossible without removing operator capability. Row 0 (substrate) gates 2 + 3 — short-lived credentials need somewhere to live.

| Deliverable                                                                                                                 | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Est | Work Item   |

### Walk (P1) — App-mediated operator actions

### Run (P2) — SOC2 evidence + cadence

**Goal:** the controls have written runbooks, periodic-review evidence, and pass an external audit.

## Dependencies

- `proj.database-ops` — backup/restore + connection pooling complete the data-tier story; SOC2 evidence for restore tests integrates here. OpenBao DB engine dynamic credentials (Crawl row 3) consumes the same per-role grants this project defines.
- `proj.cicd-services-gitops` — bastion + signed SSH cert issuance fits the GitOps + workflow-dispatch model already used for `candidate-flight-infra`. ESO + OpenBao install lands as new Argo CD applications under `infra/k8s/argocd/`, same shape as the existing `image-updater` bootstrap (controller installed; allowlist empty — see `scripts/ci/check-image-updater-scope.sh`).
- Pre-existing `.local/{env}-vm-key` onboarding pattern (`docs/guides/multi-node-deploy.md`) — Crawl row 1 narrows it to non-prod only. ESO replaces the broader `.local/<env>-vm-secrets.env` pattern for app-runtime secrets; provision-only bootstrap secrets (the ESO auth seed itself) stay file-based by necessity.

## As-Built Specs

None yet — every Walk/Run deliverable will land its own spec under `docs/spec/security/` as it ships. Tracking issues to be linked here as the project advances.

## Design Notes

- **Out of scope vs `proj.poly-web3-security-hardening`** — that project covers chain-side write safety (pre-flight checks, post-flight verification, anvil-fork regression). This project covers operator-side access control. The two intersect at "who can call admin endpoints that trigger on-chain writes" but the disciplines are different.
- **App-level RLS is already a strong control** — this project does not weaken it. The gap is that a superuser shell BYPASSES RLS; the fix is to remove the superuser shell from the operator workflow, not to redo RLS.
- **Maker-checker as feature flag, not big-bang** — Walk row 3 is enforce-per-endpoint so the rollout can prove value on cap-bump first before extending to redeem-reconcile and beyond.
- **Audit log is the truth, not a logging concern** — `operator_audit_log` is a domain entity (append-only ledger) populated synchronously by every admin endpoint, not a side-channel from an APM. Retention + integrity guarantees come from DB constraints, not from app correctness.
- **Why OpenBao over alternatives** — Apache 2.0 OSS sovereign (Vault fork from the IBM-acquisition relicense). Supports the same secret engines as Vault (KV, PKI, SSH CA, DB dynamic credentials), the same auth methods (Kubernetes, OIDC, AppRole), and the same ESO provider plugin (`SecretStore: provider: vault` works against OpenBao). Sealed Secrets considered and rejected — cluster-bound keys make re-keying after a VM rebuild painful; doesn't support dynamic credentials. SOPS + ksops considered and rejected — current scaffold already documents its own decay; ksops going dormant upstream. AWS Secrets Manager / 1Password Connect considered and rejected as defaults — vendor lock against the OSS-first constraint; forks can still pick them via ESO's provider model.
- **Tier-2 (operator-managed multi-tenant KMS) is out of scope here** — that's a Cogni operator-app product capability, not a node-template baseline concern. Tracked separately (filed as a stub task under the operator project; not committed in this Roadmap). The Tier-1 design intentionally leaves an `OperatorKmsProvider` shaped hole — when Tier-2 lands, forks opt in by swapping the SecretStore backend, not by rewriting their consumers.
- **OIDC over long-lived PATs** — Crawl row 1 (revoke prod SSH) pairs with switching GitHub Actions auth to OpenBao via OIDC federation. Eliminates the "GHCR_PAT / SSH_KEY / ACTIONS_AUTOMATION_BOT_PAT lives in GitHub env" pattern entirely. Workflows exchange the OIDC token for a short-lived OpenBao token at job start; expires on job end.

# Broadcasting — Multi-Platform Content Publishing Pipeline

> Research: [spike.0158](../items/spike.0158.broadcasting-platform-integration.md) → [docs/research/broadcasting-platform-integration.md](../../docs/research/broadcasting-platform-integration.md)

## Goal

Enable AI-generated content to be drafted, optimized per platform, reviewed by humans, and published across multiple platforms — all through a single pipeline where every platform is a swappable adapter behind a shared port. Blog posts and social posts share the same core domain model (`ContentMessage → PlatformPost`). Engagement tracking, campaign grouping, and retry audit trails are added in Walk phase.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Core Pipeline + Echo Publisher

**Goal:** A `ContentMessage` can be drafted, AI-optimized per platform via LLM, reviewed by a human, and published (echo adapter for Crawl). Use-case seam in `broadcast-core` enables Temporal to wrap later without rewriting. Real platform adapters are follow-up tasks.

| Deliverable                                                                              | Status      | Est | Work Item |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------- |

### Walk (P1) — Schema Evolution + LinkedIn + Blog + Engagement

**Goal:** Split `broadcast_runs` out of `platform_posts` for retry auditing. Add `engagement_snapshots` and `campaigns` tables. LinkedIn and Blog adapters join the pipeline. Engagement feedback loop operational. Campaigns group related messages.

| Deliverable                                                                        | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

### Run (P2+) — Full Suite

**Goal:** Rich content types, analytics dashboard, A/B testing, and cross-platform threading.

| Deliverable                                                              | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

## Constraints

- Blog posts and social posts share the same `ContentMessage → PlatformPost` pipeline — no separate code paths
- Every platform is a `PublishPort` adapter — adding a platform never modifies core, features, or workflows
- HIGH-risk posts must receive explicit human approval (no auto-approve)
- Crawl uses 2 tables (`content_messages`, `platform_posts` with inline publish result); Walk splits out `broadcast_runs`, adds `engagement_snapshots` and `campaigns`
- Platform adapters live in `services/` (scheduler-worker), not in `packages/` (packages have no I/O)
- Credential storage reuses `channel_registrations` AES-256-GCM pattern from `proj.messenger-channels`

## Dependencies

- [x] Temporal infrastructure operational (via `@cogni/scheduler-core`)
- [x] LangGraph graph execution (via `GraphExecutorPort`)
- [ ] `proj.messenger-channels` P0 for credential encryption utilities (can bootstrap standalone if needed)
- [ ] Blog dev's CMS/publishing system design (for Walk phase Blog adapter alignment)

## As-Built Specs

- [Broadcasting Spec (draft)](../../docs/spec/broadcasting.md) — domain model, ports, schema, workflow, invariants

## Design Notes

- Research found that 4 platforms (Discord, Bluesky, X, LinkedIn) cover ~80% of developer audience with ~20% of effort
- Thin wrapper (~800 LOC) preferred over Postiz dependency — avoids Redis/NestJS/Prisma operational burden
- Blog alignment achieved by making blog "just another PlatformId" — same optimization, review, and publishing pipeline
- Temporal Signals used for review gate (durable pause surviving restarts)
- Engagement feedback loop uses Temporal child workflows with scheduled collection windows

# Broadcasting — Multi-Platform Content Publishing Pipeline

> Research: [spike.0158](../items/spike.0158.broadcasting-platform-integration.md) → [docs/research/broadcasting-platform-integration.md](../../docs/research/broadcasting-platform-integration.md)

## Goal

Enable AI-generated content to be drafted, optimized per platform, reviewed by humans, and published across multiple platforms — all through a single pipeline where every platform is a swappable adapter behind a shared port. Blog posts and social posts share the same core domain model (`ContentMessage → PlatformPost`). Engagement tracking, campaign grouping, and retry audit trails are added in Walk phase.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — Core Pipeline + 3 Social Platforms

**Goal:** A `ContentMessage` can be drafted, AI-optimized for each target platform, reviewed via Temporal Signal, and published to Discord + Bluesky + X. Simplified 2-table schema (`content_messages` + `platform_posts` with inline publish result).

| Deliverable                                                                                 | Status      | Est | Work Item |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | --------- |
| `packages/broadcast-core` — domain model, enums, port interfaces, errors                    | Not Started | 1.5 | task.0159 |
| `packages/db-schema/src/broadcasting.ts` — 2 tables with RLS                                | Not Started | 0.5 | task.0159 |
| `packages/db-client` — Drizzle broadcast adapters (User + Worker ports)                     | Not Started | 1.5 | task.0159 |
| Discord `PublishPort` adapter (webhook)                                                     | Not Started | 0.5 | —         |
| Bluesky `PublishPort` adapter (`@atproto/api`)                                              | Not Started | 0.5 | —         |
| X/Twitter `PublishPort` adapter (OAuth 2.0, free tier)                                      | Not Started | 1   | task.0159 |
| `broadcastWorkflow` Temporal workflow (draft → review signal → publish)                     | Not Started | 2   | task.0159 |
| `ContentOptimizerPort` basic implementation (LLM via GraphExecutorPort)                     | Not Started | 1   | task.0159 |
| API contracts (`broadcast.draft.v1`, `broadcast.review.v1`, `broadcast.status.v1`) + routes | Not Started | 1   | task.0159 |

### Walk (P1) — Schema Evolution + LinkedIn + Blog + Engagement

**Goal:** Split `broadcast_runs` out of `platform_posts` for retry auditing. Add `engagement_snapshots` and `campaigns` tables. LinkedIn and Blog adapters join the pipeline. Engagement feedback loop operational. Campaigns group related messages.

| Deliverable                                                                        | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| `broadcast_runs` table — split publish results out of `platform_posts` + migration | Not Started | 1   | (create at P1 start) |
| `engagement_snapshots` table + `EngagementPort` adapters (Bluesky, X, Blog)        | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |

| Cron-scheduled broadcasting via `@cogni/scheduler-core`                            | Not Started | 1   | (create at P1 start) |

### Run (P2+) — Full Suite

**Goal:** Rich content types, analytics dashboard, A/B testing, and cross-platform threading.

| Deliverable                                                              | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

## Constraints

- Blog posts and social posts share the same `ContentMessage → PlatformPost` pipeline — no separate code paths
- Every platform is a `PublishPort` adapter — adding a platform never modifies core, features, or workflows
- HIGH-risk posts must receive explicit human approval (no auto-approve)
- Crawl uses 2 tables (`content_messages`, `platform_posts` with inline publish result); Walk splits out `broadcast_runs`, adds `engagement_snapshots` and `campaigns`
- Platform adapters live in `services/` (scheduler-worker), not in `packages/` (packages have no I/O)
- Credential storage reuses `channel_registrations` AES-256-GCM pattern from `proj.messenger-channels`

## Dependencies

- [x] Temporal infrastructure operational (via `@cogni/scheduler-core`)
- [x] LangGraph graph execution (via `GraphExecutorPort`)
- [ ] `proj.messenger-channels` P0 for credential encryption utilities (can bootstrap standalone if needed)
- [ ] Blog dev's CMS/publishing system design (for Walk phase Blog adapter alignment)

## As-Built Specs

- [Broadcasting Spec (draft)](../../docs/spec/broadcasting.md) — domain model, ports, schema, workflow, invariants

## Design Notes

- Research found that 4 platforms (Discord, Bluesky, X, LinkedIn) cover ~80% of developer audience with ~20% of effort
- Thin wrapper (~800 LOC) preferred over Postiz dependency — avoids Redis/NestJS/Prisma operational burden
- Blog alignment achieved by making blog "just another PlatformId" — same optimization, review, and publishing pipeline
- Temporal Signals used for review gate (durable pause surviving restarts)
- Engagement feedback loop uses Temporal child workflows with scheduled collection windows

summary: Get the trunk-based pipeline fully green — PR build → candidate-a flight → merge → preview flight → preview review → release → production
outcome: One clean flow from feature PR through production with no rebuilds, pre-merge candidate validation, post-merge preview lease, policy-gated release, and first-class deploy-infra reconciliation on both candidate-a and preview VMs

# CI/CD Pipeline

## Goal

Get the trunk-based pipeline fully green: `pr-build.yml` builds once, `candidate-flight.yml` flies selected PRs into the `candidate-a` slot pre-merge, merged PRs auto-flight to preview via `flight-preview.yml` with a three-value review lease, and `release.yml` policy-gates promotion to production. Task.0293 (PR #870) landed the merge-to-preview lane. Remaining blockers below, plus the critical `candidate-flight` → `deploy-infra` gap tracked in bug.0312.

## Pipeline Health

```
build → promote → deploy-infra → verify → e2e → preview → release → production
GREEN    GREEN      GREEN          AMBER    TBD    TBD       NEW       LEGACY
```

Verify is AMBER: TLS rate limit (resets hourly). Build Multi-Node + CI running on latest push. E2E, preview promotion (new `flight-preview.sh`), and release (`release.yml`) are untested in production — first real run pending.

> **Candidate-A Compose infra gap:** `candidate-flight.yml` only rsyncs k8s overlays to `deploy/candidate-a` — it does **not** run `scripts/ci/deploy-infra.sh` against the candidate-a VM. Compose service changes (`infra/compose/**`) reach candidate-a only via the initial `provision-test-vm.sh` bootstrap. Post-merge compose infra changes flow to preview via `flight-preview.yml` → `promote-and-deploy.yml env=preview` only. See bug.0312 for the remediation path.

## E2E Success Milestone (Project Completion Gate)

Project is complete when one work item achieves `deploy_verified=true` via fully autonomous pipeline:

```
✅ PR merged (code gate — needs_implement → done)
✅ candidate-flight dispatched by pr-manager (task.0297: flightCandidate)
✅ getCandidateHealth() → healthy scorecard (task.0308: memory < 90%, restarts=0, oom_kills=0)
✅ qa-agent: feature exercised (exercise: field from work item ## Validation)
✅ Loki observability signal confirmed at deployed SHA (observability: field from work item)
✅ deploy_verified = true set autonomously by qa-agent (task.0309)
```

**vNext gate (not in v0):** qa-agent posts `qa-validation` commit status on PR head SHA via GitHub App → becomes third PR merge gate alongside `build-images` and `candidate-flight`.

### Walk (P1) — DSN-Only Provisioning & Build Improvements

## Constraints

- **IMAGE_IMMUTABILITY**: Tags are `{env}-{sha}-{service}` or content-addressed; never `:latest`
- **MANIFEST_DRIVEN_DEPLOY**: Promotion = overlay digest change, not rebuild
- **BUILD_ONCE_PROMOTE**: `pr-build.yml` builds `pr-{N}-{sha}` once; `flight-preview.yml` re-tags to `preview-{sha}`; preview and production promote the exact same digests
- **NO_SSH_PAST_GITOPS**: No SSH deploy after production joins promote-and-deploy chain
- **AFFECTED_ONLY_CI**: Run lint/test/build only for changed packages (target: Turborepo, task.0260)

## Dependencies

- [x] EndpointSlice IPs on deploy branches + Temporal namespace bootstrap — fixed in #774. Provision writes IPs, promote writes digests. One writer per deploy fact.
- [ ] turbo.json pipeline config (blocks affected-only CI)

The following content was removed from this project during the 2026-04-05 stabilization cleanup. It lives in dedicated specs/projects:

- **Preview Environments** → [preview-deployments.md](../../docs/spec/preview-deployments.md)
- **Health Probe Separation** → [health-probes.md](../../docs/spec/health-probes.md)
- **Node → Operator Migration** → [node-operator-contract.md](../../docs/spec/node-operator-contract.md) (needs its own project file)
- **Scaling Infrastructure** (HPA, managed Postgres, CDN) → trigger-based, not active
- **CI Portability / Dagger** → deferred, evaluate when GitHub Actions becomes limiting
- **CI Acceleration / Turborepo** → task.0260, referenced in constraints above

## Design Notes

Content aggregated from original CI/CD roadmap docs during 2026-04-05 stabilization pass. See Relocated Sections above for pointers.

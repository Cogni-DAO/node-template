# CI/CD Pipeline

## Goal

Get the canary-first pipeline fully green: build once on canary, promote proven digests through preview to production. Currently 60% complete — build, promote-k8s, and deploy-infra work. Everything after verify is blocked (other dev actively fixing EndpointSlice routing + Temporal bootstrap). Even when unblocked, 9 verified gaps prevent clean end-to-end release flow.

## Pipeline Health

```
build → promote → deploy-infra → verify → e2e → promote-to-preview
GREEN    GREEN      AMBER          GREEN    GREEN   GREEN
```

Canary full chain GREEN. Production deployed and healthy. deploy-infra AMBER: OpenClaw healthcheck skip works but Alloy/git-sync/repo-init health gate too strict.

## Branch Model (updated 2026-04-06)

```
feat/* → canary → release/* → main (default)
deploy/canary, deploy/preview, deploy/production  (deploy state)
```

- **`main`** is the default branch (changed from `staging` on 2026-04-06)
- **`staging`** is DEPRECATED — kept temporarily for workflow_run compatibility, will be deleted
- `workflow_run` reads from `main` now
- No more cherry-pick tax between branches

### Walk (P1) — DSN-Only Provisioning & Build Improvements

## Constraints

- **IMAGE_IMMUTABILITY**: Tags are `{env}-{sha}-{service}` or content-addressed; never `:latest`
- **MANIFEST_DRIVEN_DEPLOY**: Promotion = overlay digest change, not rebuild
- **BUILD_ONCE_PROMOTE**: Canary builds images; preview and production promote the exact same digests
- **NO_SSH_PAST_GITOPS**: No SSH deploy after production joins promote-and-deploy chain
- **AFFECTED_ONLY_CI**: Run lint/test/build only for changed packages (target: Turborepo, task.0260)

## Dependencies

- [x] EndpointSlice IPs on deploy branches + Temporal namespace bootstrap — fixed in #774. Provision writes IPs, promote writes digests. One writer per deploy fact.
- [ ] turbo.json pipeline config (blocks affected-only CI)

## Relocated Sections

The following content was removed from this project during the 2026-04-05 stabilization cleanup. It lives in dedicated specs/projects:

- **Preview Environments** → [preview-deployments.md](../../docs/spec/preview-deployments.md)
- **Health Probe Separation** → [health-probes.md](../../docs/spec/health-probes.md)
- **Node → Operator Migration** → [node-operator-contract.md](../../docs/spec/node-operator-contract.md) (needs its own project file)
- **Scaling Infrastructure** (HPA, managed Postgres, CDN) → trigger-based, not active
- **CI Portability / Dagger** → deferred, evaluate when GitHub Actions becomes limiting
- **CI Acceleration / Turborepo** → task.0260, referenced in constraints above

## Design Notes

Content aggregated from original CI/CD roadmap docs during 2026-04-05 stabilization pass. See Relocated Sections above for pointers.

# [Initiative Title]

## Goal

What is this initiative trying to achieve? One paragraph.

## Roadmap

<!-- Each phase has a deliverable table with status, estimate, and optional work item link. -->
<!-- A work item (wi.*) can appear in multiple deliverable rows — detail lives in the issue's Execution Checklist. -->

### Crawl (P0)

**Goal:** Minimal viable implementation. What must work first?

| Deliverable   | Status      | Est | Work Item                               |
| ------------- | ----------- | --- | --------------------------------------- |
| Deliverable 1 | Not Started | 2   | [wi.name-001](../issues/wi.name-001.md) |
| Deliverable 2 | Not Started | 1   | —                                       |

### Walk (P1)

**Goal:** Expand scope. What comes next?

| Deliverable   | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Deliverable 3 | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |

### Run (P2+)

**Goal:** Full vision. What's the end state?

| Deliverable   | Status      | Est | Work Item            |
| ------------- | ----------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Deliverable 4 | Not Started | 3   | (create at P2 start) |

## Constraints

- Constraint 1
- Constraint 2

## Dependencies

- [ ] Dependency 1
- [ ] Dependency 2

## As-Built Specs

<!-- Link to specs AFTER implementation lands. Specs describe what IS, not what WILL BE. -->

- (none yet — specs created when code merges)

## Design Notes

<!-- Messy iteration, options, tradeoffs live here. NOT in specs. -->

# SUSTAINABILITY Charter

## Goal

Define SUSTAINABILITY priorities for budget protection and veto governance loops.

|          |     |       |       |

## Constraints

- One focus per run
- One decision per run (`action` or `no-op`)
- Produce/update budget-veto header each run before other charter loops consume it

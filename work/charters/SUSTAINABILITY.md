# SUSTAINABILITY Charter

## Goal

Align incentives, monitoring, and workflows to build sustained syntropy and symbiosis with the living world around it. Reduce sprawl, entropy, and inefficient consumption.
Cogni is a self-governing deployed application. This project must remain durable and reliable over time.
Increase KPI awareness of yourself and all things involved in keeping you running.

| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| P0       | Cogni has full observability over Cogni: it's codebase, deployment, community, impact, etc | 0           | Not Started |       |
| P1       | Financial sustainability: budget awareness, cost control, spend monitoring                 | 0           | Not Started |       |
| P2       | Self healing: Autonomous governance loops that empower syntropy without humans.            | 0           | Not Started |       |

## Constraints

- Execution 100% dependent on one human (Derek)
- Agent has no access to observability data yet
- Agent has no access to community channels yet
- Agent cannot autonomously trigger deployments or restarts

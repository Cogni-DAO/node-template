# SUSTAINABILITY Charter

## Goal

Define SUSTAINABILITY priorities for budget protection and recommendation governance loops.  
Known TODO: humans filling out the charters.

## Projects

### Core mission / priorities

| Priority | Target | Score (0-5) | Status | Notes |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| P0       |        |             |        |       |
| P1       |        |             |        |       |
| P2       |        |             |        |       |

### Top projects (max 4)

| Project | Why now | Score (0-5) | Status | Notes |
| ------- | ------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- |
|         |         |             |        |       |
|         |         |             |        |       |
|         |         |             |        |       |
|         |         |             |        |       |

### Skills / resources

| Resource | Use | Where | Notes |
| -------- | --- | ----- | ----- |
|          |     |       |       |
|          |     |       |       |
|          |     |       |       |

## Constraints

- One focus per run
- One decision per run (`action` or `no-op`)
- Produce budget recommendations and risk signals; do not write the live gate
- Read and respect GOVERN-owned live gate at `memory/_budget_header.md`

- Humans must set priorities, project scores, and status in this charter before autonomous runs should be trusted.

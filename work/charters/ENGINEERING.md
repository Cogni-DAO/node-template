# ENGINEERING Charter

## Goal

Ship reliable code that brings charters' goals to life. Maintain quality through testing, CI/CD, and optimization loops. Build skills and workflows that accelerate delivery.

See [@docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md](../../docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md) for workflow standards.

## Charter Work Requests

_Updated by governance skills - shows what work other charters need from ENGINEERING_

| Charter | Priority | Severity | Work Item                      | Status      | Notes                                               |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SUSTAIN | 0        | High     | `proj.observability-hardening` | Queued      | BLOCKING: Can't optimize what you can't see         |
| COMM    | 0        | High     | `proj.messenger-channels`      | Queued      | BLOCKING: P0 for community reach                    |
| SUSTAIN | 1        | High     | `proj.context-optimization`    | In Progress | $5.50/run unsustainable (needs observability first) |
| SUSTAIN | 1        | Med      | `proj.governance-agents`       | Queued      | Signal infra for governance loops                   |
| COMM    | 2        | Low      | `proj.sourcecred-onchain`      | Paused      | Cred system doesn't run                             |

## Principles

- **Maximize OSS**: Prefer open-source tools and dependencies over proprietary/vendor solutions
- **Test-first reliability**: Code only works if tested end-to-end and aligned with spec invariants
- **Workflow discipline**: Follow [@development-lifecycle](../../docs/spec/development-lifecycle.md) - from `/idea` to `/closeout`

## Projects

### Core mission / priorities

| Priority | Target                                                                 | Score (0-5) | Status      | Notes |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 0        | Delivery velocity: tight feedback loops accelerate workflow efficiency | 0           | Not Started |       |
| 1        | Test infrastructure: agents + humans validate before ship              | 0           | Not Started |       |
| 2        | Code quality: specs enforced, best practices followed                  | 0           | Not Started |       |

### Top projects (max 4)

_ENGINEERING-owned infrastructure. Feature delivery projects live in their respective charters; GOVERN handles cross-charter prioritization._

| Project                         | Why now                                      | Score (0-5) | Status      | Notes |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----- |
| `proj.development-workflows`    | Standardize spec/PR/agent workflows          | 0           | Not Started |       |
| `proj.agent-dev-testing`        | Self-validating agents (lint/test/e2e gates) | 0           | Not Started |       |
| `proj.system-test-architecture` | Mock-LLM test infra, system integration      | 0           | Not Started |       |
| `proj.context-optimization`     | Token efficiency for multi-call workflows    | 0           | Not Started |       |

## Constraints

- Development execution 100% dependent on one human (Derek)
- No CI/CD for governance workflows yet (only app CI exists)
- Agents cannot run full stack/comp tests to self-validate code before submitting PRs
- Limited test coverage for governance/scheduler infrastructure
- Development workflows brand new, require iteration and refinement

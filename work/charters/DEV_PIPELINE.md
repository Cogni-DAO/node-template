# Development Pipeline Maturity

> How well does the AI system track and drive work items end-to-end, from idea to production?

## Goal

Track maturity across every stage of the development pipeline — from idea to production and back. Each stage gets a percentage score based on what infrastructure exists, what's automated, and what's AI-driven. Make gaps visible so engineering investment targets the weakest link.

## Projects

| Project                      | Relationship                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `proj.cicd-services-gitops`  | Deploy pipeline + image promotion               |
| `proj.operator-plane`        | Dashboard, streams, AI tools                    |
| `proj.development-workflows` | Status-driven lifecycle, skills, agent dispatch |

## Constraints

- No CI status on dashboard — PRs have no visible CI state on the operator dashboard
- No deploy events in stream — deploys happen but dashboard doesn't know
- Git manager not active — PR manager agent exists but isn't scheduled
- No work item → PR → deploy linkage — three systems (work/, GitHub, deploy) are disconnected
- No eval pipeline — can't measure if AI output quality is improving

## Relationship to Other Charters

| Charter        | Relationship                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ENGINEERING    | Parent — this is ENGINEERING's core mission operationalized              |
| DATA_STREAMS   | Sibling — data streams tracks _data source_ maturity; this tracks _SDLC_ |
| SUSTAINABILITY | Consumer — observability feeds back into pipeline health                 |
| EVALS          | Consumer — eval results validate pipeline output quality                 |

## The Chain

## Maturity Levels (Universal)

| Level | Meaning                                                           |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0%    | No tooling — fully manual, human-only                             |
| 20%   | Scripts/CLI exist — human triggers manually                       |
| 40%   | Semi-automated — human initiates, automation executes             |
| 60%   | AI-assisted — AI agent can perform with human approval            |
| 80%   | AI-driven — AI agent performs autonomously, human reviews results |
| 100%  | Closed-loop — AI performs, validates, and self-corrects           |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Wire `workflow_run` webhook → `CiStatusEvent` → dashboard (PR #813 in progress)
2. ~~Make PR numbers clickable in Git Activity feed (link to GitHub)~~ ✅ Done
3. Add `deploy_verified` auto-set when deploy succeeds
4. Schedule git-manager agent (even at 30min intervals)
5. Design work-item-linked dashboard view (the "Active Work" panel)

## What This Charter Does NOT Own

- Individual data source maturity (→ DATA_STREAMS)
- AI model quality benchmarks (→ EVALS)
- Cost optimization (→ SUSTAINABILITY)
- Agent prompt engineering (→ per-agent specs)

This charter owns the **pipeline itself** — the chain from idea to production and back.

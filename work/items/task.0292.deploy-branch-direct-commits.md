outcome: "All three deploy branches (canary, preview, production) updated via direct bot commits. No PR noise on deploy/* branches. Git history is the audit trail."

# Deploy branches: direct commits for all envs

## Context

`promote-and-deploy.yml` has two code paths for updating deploy branches:

- **Canary**: direct push (line ~222) — already working, no PR noise
- **Preview/production**: create PR + auto-merge (lines ~235-255) — unnecessary noise

Deploy branches are machine-written overlay state (image digests, EndpointSlice IPs). PRs add no review value. Git history provides the audit trail.

## Changes

1. In `promote-and-deploy.yml`, extend the canary direct-push pattern to preview and production
2. Remove the PR creation + auto-merge logic for non-canary envs
3. Keep the commit message format (provides audit trail in `git log`)

## Validation

1. Push to canary → promote-and-deploy fires → deploy/canary updated via direct commit (existing)
2. Dispatch for preview → deploy/preview updated via direct commit (new)
3. No PRs created on deploy/\* branches
4. Argo CD still syncs correctly (watches branch HEAD, not PR merge events)

# Broadcasting Crawl — core domain, schema, workflow, and X adapter

## Context

This is the foundational Crawl (P0) task for [proj.broadcasting](../projects/proj.broadcasting.md). It delivers a vertical slice: everything needed to draft a content message, optimize it for X/Twitter, gate it through human review, and publish it. Discord and Bluesky adapters follow as lightweight tasks once this foundation lands.

**Governing spec:** [docs/spec/broadcasting.md](../../docs/spec/broadcasting.md)

## Requirements

1. **`packages/broadcast-core`** — new package exporting domain types, enums, port interfaces, error classes, and pure rule functions. No I/O. Mirrors `@cogni/scheduler-core` structure.
2. **`packages/db-schema/src/broadcasting.ts`** — 2 Drizzle tables (`content_messages`, `platform_posts`) with RLS, matching the Crawl schema in the spec. Barrel-exported from `packages/db-schema`.
3. **`packages/db-client`** — Drizzle adapters implementing `BroadcastLedgerUserPort` (appDb, RLS) and `BroadcastLedgerWorkerPort` (serviceDb). Follow `withTenantScope` pattern from existing adapters.
4. **X/Twitter `PublishPort` adapter** — in `services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/broadcast/`. OAuth 2.0 bearer token, `POST /2/tweets`, `DELETE /2/tweets/:id`. Health check via token validation.
5. **`ContentOptimizerPort` basic implementation** — LLM-based optimization via `GraphExecutorPort`. Produces platform-formatted body for X (280 chars, hashtags, thread splitting if over limit).
6. **`broadcastWorkflow` Temporal workflow** — orchestrates: optimize → assess risk → review gate (Signal) → publish. Activities for each I/O step. Signal handler for `review-decision`.
7. **API contracts** — `broadcast.draft.v1`, `broadcast.review.v1`, `broadcast.status.v1` in `apps/web/src/contracts/`. Zod schemas as single source of truth.
8. **API routes** — `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/broadcast/` — POST (draft), PATCH (review), GET (status). Auth via `getSessionUser`, DI via `getContainer`.
9. **Container wiring** — register broadcast adapters and services in the app's DI container.

### Invariants (from spec)

- **MESSAGE_IS_PLATFORM_AGNOSTIC** — `ContentMessage.body` has no platform-specific formatting
- **ONE_POST_PER_PLATFORM** — unique index enforced at DB level
- **REVIEW_BEFORE_HIGH_RISK** — HIGH-risk posts block until explicit approval Signal
- **ADAPTERS_ARE_SWAPPABLE** — adding Discord/Bluesky later requires only a new `PublishPort` impl + optimizer strategy, no core/workflow changes
- **TEMPORAL_OWNS_DURABILITY** — no application-level retry loops

## Allowed Changes

- [ ] Implement `publish()` — `POST https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets`
- [ ] Implement `delete()` — `DELETE https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/:id`
- [ ] Implement `healthCheck()` — token validation
- [ ] Handle rate limiting (free tier: 1,500 tweets/month)

### 8. Content Optimizer

- [ ] Create `services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/broadcast/x-content-optimizer.adapter.ts`
- [ ] Implement optimization via `GraphExecutorPort` — 280-char limit, hashtags, thread splitting

### 9. Temporal Workflow + Activities

- [ ] Contract tests for API contracts (schema validation)
- [ ] Unit tests for Drizzle adapters (mock DB)
- [ ] Unit tests for X adapter (mock HTTP)

### 12. Validate

- [ ] `pnpm packages:build` — broadcast-core builds
- [ ] `pnpm check` — lint, types, format all pass
- [ ] `pnpm test` — all unit tests pass
- [ ] Verify adding a new platform adapter requires zero changes to core/workflow/features

## Validation

**Commands:**

```bash
pnpm packages:build          # broadcast-core compiles
pnpm check                   # lint + type + format (CI-fast)
pnpm test                    # unit tests pass
pnpm test:contract           # contract tests pass
```

**Expected:** All pass with zero errors.

**Manual verification:**

- POST `/api/v1/broadcast` with `{ body: "Test post", targetPlatforms: ["x"] }` creates a ContentMessage and starts the Temporal workflow
- GET `/api/v1/broadcast/{id}` returns the message with its PlatformPost (status progresses through optimize → review)
- PATCH `/api/v1/broadcast/{id}/review` with `{ platformPostId, decision: "approved" }` sends a Temporal Signal and triggers publish
- After publish, PlatformPost has `externalId` and `externalUrl` populated

## Review Feedback

### Blocking Issues (revision 1)

1. **Unsafe status filter cast** — `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/broadcasting/route.ts:131-132`: Query parameter `?status=X` is cast directly to `ContentMessage["status"]` via `as` without validation. Allows arbitrary strings to reach the database query. **Fix:** Validate against `CONTENT_MESSAGE_STATUSES` array or use a Zod schema parse.

2. **`as never` type escapes** — `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/broadcasting/[messageId]/route.ts:82` and `apps/web/src/app/api/v1/broadcasting/[messageId]/posts/[postId]/review/route.ts:98`: Uses `as never` to bypass branded type system. **Fix:** Use `toContentMessageId(messageId)` and `toPlatformPostId(postId)` from `@cogni/broadcast-core`.

3. **`"edited"` decision without `editedBody`** — `packages/db-client/src/adapters/drizzle-broadcast-user.adapter.ts:213-216`: When `decision === "edited"` but `editedBody` is undefined, the method does not set status, leaving the post in an inconsistent state (e.g., stuck in `pending_review`). **Fix:** Either require `editedBody` when decision is `"edited"` (throw if missing), or treat `"edited"` without body as `"approved"`.

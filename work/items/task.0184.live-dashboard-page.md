# Live Dashboard Page

## Context

P0 of the live operations dashboard. Static card grid powered by the run list API (task.0183). No live streaming yet — that's P1 after task.0182 ships. This task establishes the page structure, card component, and tab-based filtering.

## Requirements

### Card Component

- **Collapsed state**: Status dot (green pulse=running, gray=pending, checkmark=done, red=error), graph display name, elapsed timer (live-updating for running), 1-line summary
- **Duration display**: "Running for 2m 34s" (running) or "Completed in 45s" (done) or "Failed after 1m 12s" (error)
- **Error display**: Shows error_code badge on error cards

### Page Layout

- Tab switcher: "My Runs" (default) / "System" (admin-only, hidden for non-admins)
- Card grid: responsive (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- Auto-refresh: React Query polling at 5s
- Empty state: "No active runs" with link to start a chat
- Running runs pinned to top, then recent completed sorted by started_at DESC

### Auth

- Session required (redirect to login if not authenticated)
- System tab visible only to admin role

## Allowed Changes

- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — new page
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/view.tsx` — client view
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_api/` — API fetch functions
- `apps/web/src/components/kit/data-display/RunCard.tsx` — new card component
- `apps/web/src/features/ai/hooks/useRunList.ts` — React Query hook
- Navigation update to include /dashboard link

## Design Notes

### Polsia inspiration (concept, not styling)

- Cards as primary metaphor for agent runs
- Status indicators with elapsed timers
- Dense layout showing many cards at once
- Progressive disclosure (P1 will add click-to-expand with streaming)

### What this does NOT include (deferred to P1)

- Live streaming content in expanded cards (needs task.0182)
- Content preview from Redis Streams
- Phase badges ("thinking", "tool_use")
- Click-to-expand card interaction

## Plan

- [x] **Checkpoint 1: RunCard component**
  - Kit component with status dot, graph name, elapsed timer, duration
  - All states: running (pulsing dot + live timer), pending, success, error, skipped, cancelled
  - `statusLabel` field for future AI-settable status text
  - Validation: `pnpm check` passes

- [x] **Checkpoint 2: Dashboard page + API hook**
  - Page shell with auth, tab switcher, card grid layout
  - React Query polling at 5s via `fetchRuns`
  - Running runs pinned to top via `sortRuns`
  - Active count indicator with pulsing Radio icon
  - Validation: `pnpm check` passes

- [x] **Checkpoint 3: Navigation + polish**
  - Dashboard added as first sidebar nav item (LayoutDashboard icon)
  - Empty state with "Start a Chat" CTA
  - Loading skeleton, error state
  - Responsive 1/2/3 col grid
  - Validation: `pnpm check` passes

## Validation

- `pnpm check` passes
- Manual: navigate to /dashboard, see card grid with status indicators and auto-refresh
- Manual: admin user sees System tab, regular user does not

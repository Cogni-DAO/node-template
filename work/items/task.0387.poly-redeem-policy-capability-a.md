status: needs_implement
priority: 0
rank: 1
estimate: 3
summary: "Replace the buggy hardcoded `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS = [1, 2]` predicate with a pure `decideRedeem` policy that handles binary, neg-risk-parent, neg-risk-adapter, and multi-outcome correctly. Fixture corpus is built from a Loki audit of the last 30 days of `poly.ctf.redeem.ok` events plus synthetic backfill for any class the audit doesn't cover. Wires into the existing sweep predicate so the bleed stops on merge — Capability B (event-driven queue) ships in task.0388 next."
outcome: "After this PR, the running sweep on candidate-a + production no longer fires `redeemPositions` against already-redeemed positions or with the wrong index set. The Loki signal `poly.ctf.redeem.ok` followed by zero `TransferSingle` from funder goes to zero. Capability A is importable from `packages/market-provider/policy/redeem` and is the single source of redeem-decision truth for both the legacy sweep (this PR) and the future job worker (task.0388)."

# Capability A — Pure Redeem Policy + Fixture Audit

## Why

bug.0384's POL bleed is not fundamentally a race; it is a wrong predicate that re-fires forever. The mutex + cooldown bandaid in `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts` slows the bleed; it does not stop it (active incident 2026-04-26). The actual defect: `decideRedeem` returns `ok` for positions where `redeemPositions` produces zero burn — neg-risk markets given the wrong index set, positions already redeemed by a prior tx, multi-outcome edge cases. Capability A is the pure decision function the design doc (`docs/design/poly-positions.md`) calls out as the single redeem-decision authority.

## Outcome

A pure module `packages/market-provider/policy/redeem` exporting `decideRedeem(input) → Decision` where:

- Inputs: `{ balance: bigint, payoutNumerator: bigint, payoutDenominator: bigint, outcomeIndex: number, outcomeSlotCount: number, negativeRisk: boolean }` — all chain-derived, no I/O, no SDK imports.
- Decision: discriminated union
  - `{ kind: 'redeem', flavor: 'binary' | 'neg-risk-parent' | 'neg-risk-adapter', parentCollectionId: \`0x${string}\`, indexSet: bigint[], expectedShares: bigint, expectedPayoutUsdc: bigint }`
  - `{ kind: 'skip', reason: 'zero_balance' | 'losing_outcome' | 'already_redeemed_inferred' | ... }`
  - `{ kind: 'malformed', reason: 'unknown_market_topology' | 'invalid_outcome_index' | ... }`
- 100% unit-tested against the fixture corpus described below. No viem, no clob-client, no env reads.

## Approach

**Solution.** Build the pure policy module + fixture corpus, swap the in-line `decideRedeem` in `poly-trade-executor.ts` for it. Sweep architecture (mutex, cooldown Map, polling loop) stays in this PR — Capability A is correctness for the existing loop. task.0388 rips the loop next.

**Reuses.**
- `PolymarketUserPosition` shape from `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/polymarket.data-api.types.ts` (read-only — for input mapping at the call site, not inside the pure policy).
- CTF + neg-risk adapter ABIs already present in `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/polymarket.ctf.ts` (for fixture generation — synthesizing `eth_getTransactionReceipt`-shaped events).
- Existing test infra: `vitest` unit tests in `packages/market-provider/tests/`.

**Rejected.**
- *Touch the sweep loop in this PR.* Out of scope. Big-bang rewrite is task.0388. This task is the bleed-stopper.
- *Loki audit alone.* Without synthetic backfill for any uncovered class, we ship a predicate validated only against the slice of history Loki happens to contain. Review2 explicitly blocked on this.

## Files

- Create: `packages/market-provider/policy/redeem.ts` — the pure `decideRedeem` function + `Decision` discriminated union.
- Create: `packages/market-provider/policy/redeem.fixtures.ts` — fixture corpus (real tx hashes + synthetic edge cases). Each fixture: chain-input snapshot + expected `Decision`.
- Create: `packages/market-provider/tests/redeem-policy.test.ts` — drives every fixture through `decideRedeem`, asserts exact decision match.
- Create: `scripts/experiments/audit-redeem-fixtures.ts` — one-shot Loki query + Polygonscan receipt fetch + classifier; emits a markdown report listing covered and missing classes. Re-runnable.
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts` — replace inline `decideRedeem` (lines 189–205) with import from `@cogni/market-provider/policy/redeem`. Remove `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS` hardcoding from the call site; use `decision.indexSet` and `decision.parentCollectionId` from the policy output.
- Modify: `packages/market-provider/src/index.ts` (or appropriate export point) — re-export the policy module.

## Validation

`exercise:` Run `scripts/experiments/audit-redeem-fixtures.ts` against production Loki (last 30 days) + Polygon RPC. Output report must show ≥1 fixture covering each of: `binary-winner`, `binary-loser`, `binary-already-redeemed`, `neg-risk-parent`, `neg-risk-adapter`, `multi-outcome-winner`, `multi-outcome-loser`. Any class missing from real history is backfilled in `redeem.fixtures.ts` from contract source. After deploy to candidate-a, exercise: trigger a manual redeem on a known-resolved position via `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/redeem`; tx must produce `TransferSingle(from=funder)` on the receipt.

`observability:` Loki query `{env="candidate-a"} |= "poly.ctf.redeem" | json` for the deploy SHA must show the `decideRedeem` call's structured log `policy_decision={kind, flavor, reason}`. The malformed-class events from the prior 24 hours (per the bleed incident) must stop appearing within one sweep tick post-deploy. Production Grafana panel "POL spent vs USDC redeemed slope" must show the slopes converging.

## Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] POSITION_IDENTITY_IS_CHAIN_KEYED — Capability A consumes chain reads only; Data API never enters the policy function (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] WRITE_AUTHORITY_IS_CHAIN_OR_CLOB — call-site reads `payoutNumerator` from chain, never from Data-API `redeemable` (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] NEG_RISK_REDEEM_IS_DISTINCT — `negativeRisk: true` inputs route to `neg-risk-parent` or `neg-risk-adapter` flavor; never to `binary` (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] FIXTURE_COVERAGE_COMPLETE — corpus includes ≥1 case for each of the 7 classes listed in `## Validation` (spec: poly-positions § Before /implement)
- [ ] PURE_POLICY_NO_IO — the policy module imports nothing from viem, clob-client, or app/bootstrap; verified by dep-cruiser rule (spec: architecture, packages-architecture)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION — leverages existing `vitest` + Polymarket ABI exports; no new test framework, no new RPC client (spec: architecture)

## Notes

- task.0379 ("Poly redemption sweep — top-0.1% production-grade hardening") is the project-management placeholder this work supersedes. After 0387 + 0388 land, close 0379 as `done`.
- Capability A landing alone is sufficient to stop the bleed — the existing sweep + cooldown + mutex bandaid becomes correct (just inefficient) once the predicate stops returning false-positives. task.0388 rips the inefficiency.
- Human-in-the-loop runbook for `redeem_failed → abandoned` lives in `docs/design/poly-positions.md` § Abandoned-position runbook. Capability A's fixture corpus is the artifact step 4 of that runbook updates.

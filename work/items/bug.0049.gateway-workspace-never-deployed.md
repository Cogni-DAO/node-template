title: Deploy never syncs gateway-workspace + repo mount blocks git — agent is blind and immobile
status: Backlog
priority: 0
estimate: 1
summary: deploy.sh never rsync's gateway-workspace/ (agent has no SOUL.md/GOVERN.md) and /repo is mounted :ro (agent can't git worktree/fetch/pull despite documented workflow requiring it)
outcome: Gateway agent boots with full workspace files and a writable repo it can fetch, branch, and worktree from

# Deploy never syncs gateway-workspace + repo mount blocks git — agent is blind and immobile

## Observed

PR #400 (`feat(gov)`) merged and deployed successfully. The gateway agent in production:

1. Did not recognize the `GOVERN` command (should trigger governance checklist from GOVERN.md)
2. Responded with `HEARTBEAT_OK` to unrecognized input instead of using SOUL.md personality
3. Reported "none of these files are present" when asked about SOUL.md, GOVERN.md, etc.
4. Could not `git pull` its own repo (`/repo` is mounted `:ro`)

**Root cause — two issues, both in scope:**

### Issue 1: gateway-workspace never rsync'd

`deploy.sh:805-809` only copies the JSON config:

```bash
scp ... openclaw-gateway.json ... /opt/cogni-template-runtime/openclaw/openclaw-gateway.json
```

The `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/` directory (SOUL.md, GOVERN.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md) is **never deployed**. The string `gateway-workspace` does not appear anywhere in `deploy.sh`.

Docker-compose expects it at `./openclaw/gateway-workspace` (`docker-compose.yml:466`), but since the dir doesn't exist on the host, Docker creates an **empty directory** at the mount point. The agent has been running with zero workspace files.

The dev compose correctly references the repo source via relative path (`docker-compose.dev.yml:565`):

```yaml
- ../../../../services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace:/workspace/gateway
```

### Issue 2: /repo mounted :ro — documented dev workflow is broken

`/repo` is mounted `:ro` (`docker-compose.yml:467`). The agent's own AGENTS.md documents this dev workflow:

```bash
git -C /repo/current worktree add /workspace/dev-<branch> -b <branch>
```

This **cannot work** because `git worktree add` writes to `/repo/current/.git/worktrees/`. The `:ro` mount makes the agent's documented development workflow impossible. The agent also cannot `git fetch` to update its codebase view.

The app container (`docker-compose.yml:74`) should stay `:ro` — it's a web server. But the openclaw-gateway is a developer agent that needs write access to git.

### Out of scope: hash-gated restart (task.0024)

Config-only deploys won't restart the container. Tracked by task.0024 (deploy config reconciliation). Until then, workspace-only changes require manual `docker compose restart openclaw-gateway` after deploy.

## Expected

- After deploy, gateway-workspace files are present at `/opt/cogni-template-runtime/openclaw/gateway-workspace/`
- Agent operates with SOUL.md personality and responds to GOVERN
- Agent can create worktrees, fetch, and push per its documented workflow

## Reproduction

1. Deploy to production (current state reproduces)
2. Send `GOVERN` to the gateway agent → agent doesn't recognize it (workspace empty)
3. Ask agent to create a worktree → fails (`:ro` mount)

## Impact

- **P0**: Gateway agent has NO personality, NO governance loop, NO dev capability. PR #398/#400 features are dead on arrival.
- All future workspace file changes will silently fail to deploy.
- Agent cannot follow its own documented git workflow.

## Requirements

- `deploy.sh` rsync's `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/` to `/opt/cogni-template-runtime/openclaw/gateway-workspace/`
- `docker-compose.yml:467` changes `repo_data:/repo:ro` to `repo_data:/repo` for openclaw-gateway
- After fix: GOVERN works, agent can create worktrees and git fetch

## Allowed Changes

- `platform/ci/scripts/deploy.sh` — add rsync step for gateway-workspace
- `platform/infra/services/runtime/docker-compose.yml` — remove `:ro` from openclaw-gateway repo mount

## Plan

- [ ] Add rsync of `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/` to deploy.sh (after line 809)
- [ ] Remove `:ro` from `repo_data:/repo:ro` on openclaw-gateway (`docker-compose.yml:467`)
- [ ] Test: deploy, verify workspace files present, verify `git -C /repo/current worktree add` works

## Validation

**Command:**

```bash
# After deploy, SSH to VM and verify:
ls /opt/cogni-template-runtime/openclaw/gateway-workspace/
# Expected: SOUL.md, GOVERN.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, MEMORY.md

# In gateway chat:
# Send: GOVERN
# Expected: Agent responds with EDO checklist

# Verify git works:
# Agent runs: git -C /repo/current worktree add /workspace/dev-test -b test
# Expected: worktree created successfully
```

**Expected:** Workspace files present; GOVERN works; git worktrees work.

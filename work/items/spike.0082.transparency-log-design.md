# Design: Transparency Log, Receipt Signing, and Distribution Engine

## Context

story.0081 introduces WorkReceipts, a transparency log, and a deterministic distribution engine. Before implementation, several design decisions need resolution. This spike produces a design doc answering the questions below.

## Requirements

### Research questions

1. **Receipt schema**: What exact fields, types, and constraints? How does `rule_version` reference versioned config? How do `artifact_refs` accommodate different artifact types (PR, governance run, manual approval)?

2. **Signing approach**: Ed25519 vs EIP-191 vs EIP-712 for receipt signatures? Must the signer be an Ethereum wallet (reuse SIWE key) or a separate service key? How do co-signatures work (multi-sig threshold or additive)?

3. **Transparency log storage**:
   - Postgres append-only table: what constraints enforce append-only (triggers? RBAC? application-level)?
   - Merkle tree: per-epoch batch tree or incremental (RFC 6962-style)? Stored in DB or computed on-demand?
   - Inclusion proof format: what does the API return? How does a client verify?
   - Future portability: what abstraction boundary keeps the consumer API stable if we swap to Trillian/Rekor later?

4. **Distribution engine contract**:
   - Weight rules format: YAML/JSON in repo? How is `rule_version` determined (git SHA, semver, epoch-specific)?
   - Edge cases: what if treasury is insufficient? What if a contributor has no wallet? What if rules change mid-epoch (must be forbidden — how is this enforced)?
   - Output format: payout table schema, DistributionStatement fields, how is it signed?

5. **Epoch model**: What defines an epoch boundary? Cron-based, manual trigger, block-based? What happens to receipts issued between epochs?

6. **Integration with existing systems**:
   - How does governance run approval (task.0054) feed into receipt issuance?
   - How does this relate to existing billing/charge_receipts tables?
   - Can the existing system tenant act as the receipt issuer?

### OSS landscape scan

- Evaluate Sigstore Rekor (transparency log) — useful as reference, but likely too heavy for MVP
- Evaluate merkle-tree libraries for Node/TypeScript
- Evaluate existing DAO payout tools (Coordinape, SourceCred) for schema inspiration — adopt conventions, not dependencies

## Allowed Changes

- New design doc in `docs/research/`
- No code changes — this is research only

## Plan

- [ ] Survey existing receipt/payout schemas (Coordinape, SourceCred, Gitcoin)
- [ ] Evaluate signing schemes (Ed25519 vs EIP-191) for receipt signatures
- [ ] Design Postgres append-only table schema with Merkle integrity
- [ ] Define epoch model and distribution engine contract
- [ ] Write design doc with decisions, rationale, and diagrams
- [ ] Identify task decomposition for story.0081 implementation

## Validation

**Command:**

```bash
# Design doc exists and passes docs validation
pnpm check:docs
```

**Expected:** Design doc in `docs/research/` with clear answers to all research questions. Ready for `/task` decomposition of story.0081.

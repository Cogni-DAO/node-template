title: "Capability B — event-driven redeem job queue (rips the sweep)"
status: needs_implement
priority: 0
rank: 2
estimate: 5
summary: "Replace the polling sweep + in-process mutex + in-memory cooldown Map with a Postgres-backed redeem job table driven by viem `watchContractEvent` subscriptions on CTF + neg-risk adapter. One worker drains `pending` rows via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Completion is observed `PayoutRedemption` from our funder at N=10 finality, not tx-receipt success. Removes `SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION` so poly can scale replicas. Depends on task.0387 (Capability A) for the decision policy."
outcome: "After this PR, the periodic sweep loop in `poly-trade-executor.ts` is deleted (`runRedeemSweep`, `redeemAllRedeemableResolvedPositions`, `sweepInFlight`, `redeemCooldownByConditionId`, `REDEEM_COOLDOWN_MS`). Resolution events from CTF + neg-risk adapter on Polygon enqueue jobs. One worker per pod drains them. `PayoutRedemption` from our funder is the only signal that flips a job to `confirmed`. Steady-state RPC load between resolutions drops to ~zero. The poly Deployment may run with `replicas > 1`. Three failed redeem attempts (or any malformed-class failure) escalate to `abandoned` with a Loki page following the runbook in `docs/design/poly-positions.md`."

# Capability B — Event-Driven Redeem Job Queue

## Why

Even with Capability A's predicate correct (task.0387), the polling sweep is the wrong architecture. Periodic enumerate-and-fire over a Data-API hint produces constant RPC load, races itself across ticks, requires in-process guards that die on restart, and forces `replicas: 1` in perpetuity. The design doc (`docs/design/poly-positions.md` § Capability B + Subscription) specifies a job table + `watchContractEvent` subscriptions + one worker. That is what this task ships.

## Outcome

- One Postgres table `poly_redeem_jobs` in poly's local DB. Status enum mirrors `docs/design/poly-positions.md` lifecycle: `pending | submitted | confirmed | failed_transient | abandoned`. Unique key `(funder_address, condition_id)`.
- Two viem `watchContractEvent` subscriptions, one pod, persisted `last_processed_block`:
  - CTF `ConditionResolution` → enumerate funder's positions for that condition → Capability A → INSERT pending rows.
  - CTF `PayoutRedemption` + neg-risk adapter equivalent → match `redeemer == funder` + existing job row → flip `submitted → confirmed` after N=10-block finality (re-checkable on reorg).
- One worker draining `WHERE status = 'pending' FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Submits tx, writes hash, transitions to `submitted`. On receipt: `failed_transient` (RPC/gas/reorg) goes back to `pending` with backoff if `attempt_count < 3`; `success-but-no-PayoutRedemption-from-funder within N blocks` goes straight to `abandoned` with a Loki alert (malformed class — never retry the same decision).
- Startup + daily-cron catch-up: replay historical events from `last_processed_block` to chain head through Capability A. The **only** legitimate sweep in the system, bounded by chain history.
- Manual redeem button (existing `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/redeem`): inserts a job row, then `await`s the worker outcome with a 45 s HTTP timeout (v0 single-user; promote to 202 + poll per design § Resolved during review #4 when triggers fire).
- Deletes from `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts`: `sweepInFlight`, `redeemCooldownByConditionId`, `REDEEM_COOLDOWN_MS`, `pendingRedeemMsRemaining`, `markRedeemPending`, `_resetRedeemCooldownForTests`, `_resetSweepMutexForTests`, `redeemAllRedeemableResolvedPositions`, `runRedeemSweep`, `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS` import + usages, all `SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION` doc-strings.
- Removes the `replicas: 1` constraint from the poly Deployment manifest with a comment pointing at this task.

## Approach

**Solution.** New capability package `packages/poly-redeem` containing the port (`RedeemJobsPort`), domain types (`RedeemJob`, `RedeemJobStatus`), pure transition logic, and a Postgres adapter. App-side wiring (subscriptions, worker, bootstrap) lives in `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/`. Capability A (task.0387) is the imported decision function — this task adds zero new policy.

**Reuses.**
- Capability A from task.0387 — `decideRedeem` is the single decision point.
- viem (already in use) — `watchContractEvent`, `getBlockNumber`, `getLogs` for catch-up.
- poly's existing Postgres connection + drizzle setup (per `database-expert` skill rules — operational data, not Doltgres).
- Postgres-as-queue pattern: pick one of `graphile-worker` (Node, Postgres-native, ~30s integration) or write the ~30 lines of `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Decision in `/implement`. Do not reinvent dedup.
- Pino structured logging + existing Loki ingest pipeline.

**Rejected.**
- *Keep the sweep as belt-and-suspenders.* Two truths is the bug. Resolved in design § Resolved during review #1.
- *Separate worker container.* In-process worker is fine for v0 single-pod; scaling out is straightforward later. Design § #3.
- *Manual button returns 202 + job_id.* Re-litigated in review2; v0 holds HTTP for sub-30s confirms. Design § #4.
- *Bespoke Postgres cooldown table keyed by `condition_id`.* That is a job queue with one column missing — go straight to the job model. Review2 + review1 agreed.

## Files

- Create: `packages/poly-redeem/` — new capability package per `docs/spec/packages-architecture.md`.
  - `src/types.ts` — `RedeemJob`, `RedeemJobStatus` enum, `FailureClass = 'transient' | 'malformed'`.
  - `src/port.ts` — `RedeemJobsPort` interface (enqueue, claim, transition, listForFunder, getByKey).
  - `src/transitions.ts` — pure state-machine transitions; no I/O.
  - `src/adapter.postgres.ts` — drizzle-backed adapter implementing the port.
  - `tests/transitions.test.ts` + `tests/adapter.postgres.test.ts` (testcontainers).
- Create: `nodes/poly/db-schema/migrations/NNNN_poly_redeem_jobs.sql` — table DDL, status enum, unique index.
- Create: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-redeem-subscriber.ts` — viem `watchContractEvent` subscriptions for CTF + neg-risk adapter; persists `last_processed_block`.
- Create: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-redeem-worker.ts` — drains `pending` rows, calls Capability A, submits tx, transitions states.
- Create: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-redeem-catchup.ts` — startup + cron replay from `last_processed_block` to head.
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts` — delete the listed members; `redeemResolvedPosition` becomes a thin "insert job row, await outcome" wrapper.
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/container.ts` (or equivalent) — wire subscriber + worker + catch-up at startup.
- Modify: poly Deployment manifest in `deploy/` — remove `replicas: 1` constraint with comment linking to this task.
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/AGENTS.md` — replace `SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION` warning with "redeem path is event-driven; replicas > 1 is supported".

## Validation

`exercise:` On candidate-a, observe a real market resolution end-to-end. Pre-resolution: a `winner` position exists in funder's wallet. Trigger: market resolves on Polymarket. Expected within ~60 s: subscriber observes `ConditionResolution`, Capability A returns `redeem`, job row inserted, worker submits tx, observes own `PayoutRedemption` after N=10 blocks, flips job to `confirmed`. Funder ERC-1155 balance for that position drops to 0; USDC.e balance increases by expected payout. Manual button: `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/redeem` for a different known-resolved position; HTTP returns 200 with confirmed receipt within 45 s.

`observability:` Loki at deploy SHA shows the full event chain: `poly.ctf.subscriber.condition_resolution_observed` → `poly.ctf.redeem.policy_decision{kind:'redeem'}` → `poly.ctf.redeem.job_enqueued` → `poly.ctf.redeem.tx_submitted` → `poly.ctf.subscriber.payout_redemption_observed{redeemer=funder}` → `poly.ctf.redeem.job_confirmed`. Zero `poly.ctf.redeem.sweep_*` events appear (confirms the sweep code path is dead). Grafana POL-vs-USDC slope panel shows USDC redeemed > POL spent.

## Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] REDEEM_COMPLETION_IS_EVENT_OBSERVED — `confirmed` status only after observed `PayoutRedemption` from funder at N-block finality (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] REDEEM_DEDUP_IS_PERSISTED — duplicate-redeem prevention is the unique index `(funder_address, condition_id)` on `poly_redeem_jobs`; no in-memory Maps anywhere (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] REDEEM_HAS_CIRCUIT_BREAKER — `attempt_count >= 3` OR any malformed-class failure transitions to `abandoned` and emits `poly.ctf.redeem.abandoned` Loki page (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] REDEEM_RETRY_IS_TRANSIENT_ONLY — only `transient` failures (RPC timeout, gas underpriced, reorg) re-enter `pending`; `malformed` skips the retry loop (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] SWEEP_IS_NOT_AN_ARCHITECTURE — no periodic Data-API enumerate-and-fire; the only allowed sweep is event-replay catch-up bounded by chain history (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] SINGLE_POD_REMOVED — poly Deployment manifest has no `replicas: 1` constraint and no `SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION` doc-strings remain (spec: poly-positions)
- [ ] BOUNDARY_PLACEMENT — port + domain types + transitions live in `packages/poly-redeem/`; subscription/worker/lifecycle wiring lives in `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/` (spec: packages-architecture)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION — uses Postgres-as-queue (chosen library or ~30 LOC `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`); does not introduce Redis, Temporal, or a new infrastructure dep (spec: architecture)

## Notes

- Blocked by task.0387 — Capability A must land first because this task imports `decideRedeem`. Both can be drafted in parallel; merge order is 0387 → 0388.
- After this task lands, close task.0379 ("Poly redemption sweep — top-0.1% production-grade hardening") as `done` — its scope is fully covered by 0387 + 0388.
- The reorg-handling story (confirmed → submitted on reorg-within-N) needs explicit test coverage in `tests/transitions.test.ts` and an integration test using viem's reorg simulation. Do not skip it — it is `REDEEM_COMPLETION_IS_EVENT_OBSERVED`'s teeth.

summary: "One-shot prototype task. v0 (PR-A, this PR): poly-brain + dashboard answer 'who are the top Polymarket wallets?' via a new core__wallet_top_traders tool + /dashboard Top Wallets card backed by the Polymarket Data API. v0.1 (PR-B, not in this PR): single-wallet shadow mirror via @polymarket/clob-client. No new packages, no ports, no ranking pipeline, no awareness-plane tables. If it works, we scale it; if it doesn't, we learned cheaply."
outcome: "A running prototype in the poly node. v0 (PR-A, shipped): ask poly-brain 'top wallets this week' and get a ranked list in chat + dashboard. v0.1 = four phases on a stable `decide()` boundary — P1 ships first live Polymarket order_id on one hardcoded target via disposable 30s poll scaffolding; P2 adds click-to-copy UI (DB-authoritative-when-populated, env fallback retained); P3 ships paper-adapter body so paper PnL over a real shadow soak becomes the evidence gate; P4 upgrades to WS → Redis streams → Temporal, gated on P3 evidence that edge survives slippage."

# Poly Copy-Trade Prototype

> Research: [poly-copy-trading-wallets](../../docs/research/poly-copy-trading-wallets.md)
> Spike: [spike.0314](./spike.0314.poly-copy-trading-wallets.md)

## Plan

**v0 — PR-A checkpoints (shipped):**

- [x] **Checkpoint 1 — market-provider Data-API client** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `PolymarketDataApiClient` class in `@cogni/market-provider`, verified against the saved fixture.
  - Invariants: PACKAGES_NO_ENV, READ_ONLY, CONTRACT_IS_SOT.
  - Todos: new `polymarket.data-api.types.ts` (Zod schemas) + `polymarket.data-api.client.ts` (class), extend barrel.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F @cogni/market-provider test` + fixture-driven parsing test.

- [x] **Checkpoint 2 — ai-tools `core__wallet_top_traders`** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: bound tool + stub registered in `TOOL_CATALOG`, passes schema tests.
  - Invariants: TOOL_ID_NAMESPACED, EFFECT_TYPED, REDACTION_REQUIRED, NO_LANGCHAIN.
  - Todos: new `tools/wallet-top-traders.ts`, extend `index.ts` exports + `catalog.ts`.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F @cogni/ai-tools test`.

- [x] **Checkpoint 3 — poly node wiring** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `createWalletCapability` + tool binding + `POLY_BRAIN_TOOL_IDS` entry live in the container.
  - Invariants: CAPABILITY_INJECTION, SCOPE_IS_SACRED.
  - Todos: new `bootstrap/capabilities/wallet.ts`; update `container.ts`, `tool-bindings.ts`, `poly-brain/tools.ts`.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F poly-app typecheck` + unit test on the factory.

- [x] **Checkpoint 4 — dashboard "Top Wallets" card** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `/dashboard` renders a live top-10 table with a DAY/WEEK/MONTH/ALL selector.
  - Invariants: SIMPLE_SOLUTION, CAPABILITY_NOT_ADAPTER in the API route.
  - Todos: new `/api/v1/poly/top-wallets/route.ts`, `_api/fetchTopWallets.ts`, `_components/TopWalletsCard.tsx`; modify `view.tsx`.
  - Validation: `pnpm check` clean; manual hit of the API route in dev confirms live data.

**v0.1 — four phases (each = one PR):**

- [x] **Phase 0 — Pre-flight** (no code). Findings recorded below ("Phase 0 — Findings"). P1 migration header will cite them verbatim.
- [ ] **Phase 1 — PR-B1 — First live order** (~1 week). Stable boundary (`decide()` + `clob-executor` + port Run methods + Privy `signPolymarketOrder` + DB tables) + disposable 30s poll scaffolding. 🎯 Real `order_id` on one hardcoded target.
- [ ] **Phase 2 — PR-B2 — Click-to-copy UI** (~4 days). `poly_copy_trade_targets` table + dashboard "Copy" button + Copy Targets card. DB-authoritative-when-populated; env fallback retained. Env-removal filed as follow-up.
- [ ] **Phase 3 — PR-B3 — Paper-adapter body** (~3 days). 14-day soak produces the Phase 4 GO/NO-GO evidence. Sunsets the project if no edge.
- [ ] **Phase 4 — PR-B4 — Streaming upgrade** (~1.5 weeks, **gated on P3 evidence**). WS → Redis streams → Temporal trigger → existing `decide()`. Dual-run 48h; cutover gate = zero double-fires.

## Context

Research (spike.0314) mapped the OSS and data landscape. v0.1 is structured around a **stable `decide()` boundary**: the decision function, executor, and Postgres tables are written once in P1 and survive every future migration. Scaffolding (30s poll, SELECT-backed dashboard card, `COPY_TRADE_*` env vars) is intentionally disposable — headers label it `@scaffolding` with the phase that deletes it. This avoids building the full 3-tier streaming pipeline before real fills have been observed, and avoids throwaway polling code being hardened into tech debt.

## Design

### Outcome

Two working increments, shipped as **two PRs under this one task**:

- **v0 (PR-A, read-only, merges independently) — scoreboard, chat + dashboard:**
  - user asks `poly-brain` "who are the top Polymarket wallets right now?" → agent calls a new `core__wallet_top_traders` tool → scored list with wallet / PnL / win-rate / volume / activity score rendered as a markdown table in chat.
  - `/(app)/dashboard` gets a new "Top Wallets" card — server-component table of the top ~10 wallets with the same columns, backed by the same `WalletCapability`.
- **v0.1 (PR-B, click-to-copy + realtime mirror) — shadow mirror of one wallet:** operator clicks a wallet on the Top Wallets dashboard card → row inserted into `poly_copy_trade_targets (wallet, mode='paper'|'live', mirror_usdc, max_daily_usdc, max_fills_per_hour, enabled, ...)`. A long-lived **Polymarket user WebSocket subscription** for each enabled target publishes `PolymarketFillObserved` events to the existing `@cogni/node-streams` bus. A subscriber consumes the stream, runs mirror-service decision logic, and — only if every guard passes — routes placement through the existing `MarketProviderPort`'s **Run-phase surface** (`placeOrder` / `cancelOrder` / `getOrder`). Adapter selection per-target: `mode='live'` → polymarket-clob adapter (Privy-signed on Polygon); `mode='paper'` → paper adapter (stub in PR-B, body in follow-up). A 5-min reconciliation job runs as a safety net for any WebSocket gaps. Live mode requires the target's `mode='live'` AND global kill-switch row `enabled=true`.

### Approach

**Solution:** design around a stable decision boundary. Scaffolding for data ingress is intentionally disposable; everything load-bearing lives in files that survive every future migration. Four phases, each with an explicit permanent core + labeled scaffolding + one precise E2E proof.

### Stable boundary — survives every phase

The thing that does not change between v0.1 and v1 is the decision function:

```ts
// nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/decide.ts  (pure, zero I/O)
function decide(
  fill: Fill,
  config: TargetConfig,
  state: RuntimeState
): MirrorDecision;
```

- `Fill` = normalized `{target_wallet, fill_id, market_id, outcome, side, price, size_usdc, observed_at}`.
- `TargetConfig` = `{mirror_usdc, max_daily_usdc, max_fills_per_hour, mode, enabled}`. P1 sources from env; P2+ sources from DB. Signature unchanged.
- `RuntimeState` = `{today_spent_usdc, fills_last_hour, global_enabled, already_placed_ids}` — a snapshot at call time.
- Returns `{action: 'place' | 'skip', reason, intent?}`.

What changes between phases is only how `Fill` objects arrive and how `decide()` is invoked. The function, its unit tests, and the executor it hands to are written once in Phase 1 and touched in no subsequent phase.

### Permanent deliverables (stable across all phases)

Written in Phase 1 unless otherwise noted. No later phase modifies these — only grows the calling sites.

- `packages/market-provider/src/port/market-provider.port.ts` — Run-phase methods `placeOrder` / `cancelOrder` / `getOrder`.
- `packages/market-provider/src/domain/order.ts` — `OrderIntent` / `OrderReceipt` / `OrderStatus` / `Fill` Zod schemas.
- `packages/market-provider/src/port/polymarket-order-signer.port.ts` — narrow signer interface the market adapter depends on.
- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/` — Run methods via `@polymarket/clob-client`. Sole importer of the CLOB SDK. Constructor-injected signer.
- `packages/operator-wallet/src/{port,adapters/privy}` — `signPolymarketOrder(typedData)` on Polygon EIP-712. Extends the existing adapter; reuses existing HSM custody.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/decide.ts` — pure function, heavy unit tests.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/clob-executor.ts` — takes a `MirrorIntent`, returns `{order_id}` or throws. Dynamic-import-gated on `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`; sole importer of the signer bridge.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/db/schema.ts` — `poly_copy_trade_fills`, `poly_copy_trade_config`, `poly_copy_trade_decisions`. Schema below.
- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/paper/` — adapter shape frozen in P1 (throws `NotImplemented`); body lands in Phase 3.
- Observability on `decide()` outcomes only: Pino log + Prometheus `decisions_total{outcome, reason}` counter per call. Poll-mechanism metrics are **not** instrumented.

DB schema (set in Phase 1, grown additively):

```sql
poly_copy_trade_fills (
  target_id    uuid        NOT NULL,   -- P1: synthetic UUID per env target; P2: FK to poly_copy_trade_targets
  fill_id      text        NOT NULL,   -- shape decided in Phase 0.2 (committed in this migration's header)
  observed_at  timestamptz NOT NULL,
  client_order_id text     NOT NULL,   -- hash(target_id || fill_id)
  order_id     text        NULL,       -- NULL until placeOrder completes
  status       text        NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (target_id, fill_id)
);

poly_copy_trade_config (
  singleton_id smallint PRIMARY KEY CHECK (singleton_id = 1),
  enabled      boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  updated_at   timestamptz NOT NULL,
  updated_by   text NOT NULL
);

poly_copy_trade_decisions (
  id         uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  target_id  uuid NOT NULL,
  fill_id    text NOT NULL,
  outcome    text NOT NULL,      -- 'placed' | 'skipped' | 'error'
  reason     text NULL,
  intent     jsonb NOT NULL,
  receipt    jsonb NULL,
  decided_at timestamptz NOT NULL
);
```

| 0.1   | Is a Temporal worker hosted in `POLY_ROLE=trader` today? One-line answer in PR-B1 description.

| 0.2   | **Concrete schema decision** for `poly_copy_trade_fills.fill_id`: does Data-API `listUserActivity` emit the same identifier a future user-channel WS frame will emit? Output is a one-line decision committed in the P1 migration's header comment: "`fill_id` IS the canonical `<shape>`" OR "`fill_id` IS a composite `{source, native_id}`". One sentence of rationale. Not observations — a decision. |

**🎯 Phase 0 E2E validation:** The Phase 1 schema migration file header contains the chosen `fill_id` shape + rationale; PR-B1 references it.

### Phase 0 — Findings

**0.1 — Temporal worker presence:** Temporal is deployed repo-wide; a generic `scheduler-worker` runs platform-wide schedules. **No poly-specific Temporal worker exists today.** Implication: P1–P3 need none (scheduler-core hosts the disposable poll). P4 must introduce a poly-owned trader worker (registered in `POLY_ROLE=trader`) alongside the WS ingester activity — this work is already listed under P4 Files. No P1 blocker.

**0.2 — `fill_id` shape decision:** **`fill_id` IS a composite `"<source>:<native_id>"` text.** Namespaced sources with per-source native id:

- `data-api` → native_id = `${transactionHash}:${asset}:${side}`
- `clob-ws` (P4) → native_id = operator `trade_id` (exact shape confirmed when WS frames land)

  Canonical example: `"data-api:0xabc…def:0x7e…9a:BUY"`.

  **Rationale:** Data-API `/trades` (verified against `polymarket.data-api.types.ts`) surfaces on-chain-settled trades with `transactionHash + asset + side + timestamp` but **no operator-assigned match id**. A future CLOB WS user channel emits an operator `trade_id` from a separate identifier space that does not round-trip to a settlement tx hash. Attempting a canonical id via timestamp+price+size hashing is fragile (batching, rounding, ordering). Composite ids are explicit about source lineage and let P1 (DA) and P4 (WS) PKs coexist without bilingual dedupe.

**Implication for P4 cutover (amendment).** A composite-keyed PK does NOT prevent two-source double-placement on a single logical match (DA row and WS row are distinct PKs). Therefore during the 48 h P4 dual-run, the DA poll runs in **observe-only** mode — `decide()` is still called and its outcome recorded to `poly_copy_trade_decisions`, but the executor is NOT invoked. WS is the sole placing path throughout the dual-run. The idempotency gate becomes provable by construction (single placing path → zero duplicate `(target_id, fill_id)` rows with non-null `order_id`), and the existing `decision_paths_diverged` counter captures observability divergence without doubling fills. This amendment is reflected in the Phase 4 subsection below.

---

### Phase 1 — First live order (PR-B1, ~1 week)

**Goal:** a real Polymarket `order_id` lands in `poly_copy_trade_fills` from a real fill on one hardcoded target wallet.

**Permanent:** see "Permanent deliverables" above.

**Disposable scaffolding** — each file's header MUST include `@scaffolding` + `Deleted-in-phase: 4`:

- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/jobs/copyTradeMirror.job.ts` — `@cogni/scheduler-core` 30 s poll calling `listUserActivity(ENV_TARGET_WALLET)` → normalizes to `Fill` → invokes `decide()` → on `place` calls `clob-executor`. ~80 lines. No retry hardening, no scheduling tuning, no poll-specific Grafana panels.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/copy-trade-activity-card.tsx` — server component, `SELECT * FROM poly_copy_trade_fills ORDER BY decided_at DESC LIMIT 50` with 5 s revalidate. No SSE, no streams. Phase 4 replaces with SSE reader; React surface unchanged.

**Env vars** (scaffolding-tier; fallback-retained in P2, removed in a dedicated deprecation PR after P2):

- `POLY_ROLE` (deployment role: `trader` | `web` | `scheduler`) — stays across all phases.
- `POLY_CLOB_API_KEY`, `POLY_CLOB_API_SECRET`, `POLY_CLOB_PASSPHRASE` (CLOB L2 auth — stay in env/vault across all phases).
- `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET`, `COPY_TRADE_MODE` (`paper` | `live`), `COPY_TRADE_MIRROR_USDC`, `COPY_TRADE_MAX_DAILY_USDC`, `COPY_TRADE_MAX_FILLS_PER_HOUR` — scaffolding, removed after P2.

**Signer:** Privy operator wallet gains `signPolymarketOrder` (Polygon EIP-712). Polygon support confirmed by operator. Market adapter depends only on the narrow `PolymarketOrderSigner` interface — no Privy imports, no env reads.

**Safe-proxy model** (documented in PR, manual ops):

- `signer_address` = Privy EOA (signs orders, holds no funds).
- `safe_proxy_address` = Polymarket Safe proxy (holds USDC.e, receives fills), deployed on ToS acceptance. Resolved once via `clob-client.getSafeAddress()` at adapter construction.
- One-time: accept ToS with EOA; fund the **proxy** (not the EOA) with ~$20 USDC.e on Polygon; fund the EOA with a few POL for occasional gas.

**Explicitly deferred from P1:** WebSocket ingester, Redis streams, Temporal workflows, Temporal worker wiring, `ObservationEvent` table, node-stream event types, reconciliation workflow, multi-target, click-to-copy UI, paper-adapter body, Grafana dashboards for the poll itself.

**🎯 Phase 1 E2E validation (ONE scenario):**

> Set `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET=<high-volume Polymarket wallet>`, `COPY_TRADE_MODE=live`, `UPDATE poly_copy_trade_config SET enabled=true`. Within 60 s of that wallet's next real fill, a row appears in `poly_copy_trade_fills` with a non-null `order_id`, AND the Polymarket web UI under the Cogni Safe proxy shows an open position for `$1 USDC` on the same market. Paste `order_id` + screenshot into the PR.

---

### Phase 2 — Click-to-copy UI, DB-authoritative-when-populated (PR-B2, ~4 days)

**Goal:** operator manages copy targets via dashboard, no redeploy. Phase 1's env path remains functional as a fallback.

**Permanent:**

- `poly_copy_trade_targets` table — `(id uuid PK, wallet text UNIQUE, mode text CHECK IN ('paper','live') DEFAULT 'paper', mirror_usdc numeric(10,2) DEFAULT 1.00, max_daily_usdc numeric(10,2) DEFAULT 10.00, max_fills_per_hour int DEFAULT 5, enabled boolean DEFAULT true, added_by text, added_at timestamptz, updated_at timestamptz)`.
- `_api/copy-targets.ts` — server-action CRUD, RBAC: operator role only.
- Top Wallets card: "Copy" button per row → inserts target row with `mode='paper'` default.
- `copy-targets-card.tsx` — lists active targets, mode toggle, enable/disable, remove.
- Target-resolution rule (applied in poll + any future caller):

  ```
  targets = SELECT * FROM poly_copy_trade_targets WHERE enabled = true
  if (targets.length === 0 && COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET is set) {
    log.warn("DB empty; using env fallback. Add a DB target to silence.")
    targets = [buildTargetFromEnv()]
  }
  ```

  **DB is authoritative when populated.** Env fallback only fires when the DB has zero enabled rows. This preserves Phase 1's working demo if Phase 2 ships with an empty targets table. **Env removal is explicitly deferred to a separate deprecation PR filed at P2 closeout — not in this PR.**

**Scaffolding retained:** the 30 s poll (still `Deleted-in-phase: 4`), the SQL-backed dashboard card.

**🎯 Phase 2 E2E validation (ONE scenario):**

> With `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET` unset, open `/dashboard`, click "Copy" on a top wallet → row appears in `poly_copy_trade_targets`, `mode='paper'` default. Flip to `mode='live'` via the Copy Targets card. Within one poll cycle (≤30 s) of that wallet's next fill, a new `poly_copy_trade_fills` row appears with non-null `order_id`. Click "Remove" → no further orders place. Then with env var SET and the DB target removed, the env fallback is used within one poll cycle (confirming fallback works); a warning log fires.

---

### Phase 3 — Paper-adapter body (PR-B3, ~3 days)

**Goal:** produce real paper-PnL data. This phase's output is the **evidence gate for Phase 4** — without it, Phase 4 would be gated on a handful of $1 live orders, which is too noisy to justify a ~1.5-week streaming investment.

**Permanent:**

- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/paper/` — full body. On `placeOrder(intent)`: read a book snapshot from the Polymarket read path at `observed_at + N` seconds (configurable, default 5 s), write synthetic fill price to `paper_orders` table, return a synthetic `order_id`.
- `paper_orders` table — `(id, target_id, fill_id, market_id, intent jsonb, observed_at, synthetic_price, synthetic_size, synthetic_filled_at)`.
- Container routes to `paper` adapter when `target.mode='paper'`; `decide()` unchanged; executor swap is at the container boundary only.

**🎯 Phase 3 E2E validation (ONE scenario):**

> Set `mode='paper'` on a target with known 30-day realized PnL. Run for 14 days. At end of window: (a) every tracked fill produced a `paper_orders` row within 10 s of `observed_at`; (b) cumulative paper PnL is within a **pre-declared tolerance band** (e.g. ±30 %) of the target's realized PnL; (c) the PnL curves' correlation coefficient is > 0.8. If any fail, the paper model is the bug — fix before using it to gate P4.

**Phase 4 gate criterion** (derived from P3 output): at least ONE candidate target's 14-day paper PnL, adjusted for modeled slippage, survives as positive. If no candidate survives after testing multiple, the feature sunsets at Phase 3 — Phase 4 is not built.

---

### Phase 4 — Streaming upgrade (PR-B4, ~1.5 weeks — GATED on Phase 3 evidence)

**Gate:** P3 paper-soak evidence shows positive slippage-adjusted edge on at least one representative wallet over 14 days. If not, this phase does not start.

**Permanent:**

- Temporal worker wiring in `POLY_ROLE=trader` (if P0.1 showed it was missing).
- `subscribePolymarketUserFills` activity — long-lived WS, normalizes frames to the **same `Fill` shape** `decide()` already consumes, XADDs to `streams:copy-trade:polymarket-fills` with `source_ref={target_wallet, fill_id}`. Heartbeats.
- `CopyTradeTriggerWorkflow` — tails the stream (XREAD BLOCK via activity), **calls the existing `decide()`**, pure/replay-safe; on `place` signals `MirrorOrderWorkflow` and XADDs `triggers:copy-trade`.
- `MirrorOrderWorkflow` — single activity = the existing `clob-executor` call.
- `ReconcileFillsWorkflow` — 5 min scheduled; Data-API diff vs. stream's last 16 h; missing fills XADDed into the normal pipeline.
- Dashboard card: swap SELECT-backed component for `/api/v1/node/stream` SSE reader. Renders identical decision-row list.
- Node-stream event types: `PolymarketFillObserved`, `CopyTradeDecisionMade`.

**Dual-run cutover:**

1. Deploy WS+Temporal alongside the poll. **DA poll runs in observe-only mode** during dual-run (calls `decide()`, records to `poly_copy_trade_decisions`, does NOT invoke `clob-executor`) — forced by the P0.2 composite `fill_id` decision, which makes DA and WS rows distinct PKs for the same logical match. WS is the sole placing path. `client_order_id` idempotency + `poly_copy_trade_fills` PK dedupe still backstop at-most-once on the WS path.
2. Run 48 h dual-run.
3. **Cutover gate (idempotency-based, NOT agreement-based):**

   ```sql
   SELECT target_id, fill_id, COUNT(*)
   FROM poly_copy_trade_fills
   WHERE decided_at > '<dual-run-start>'
   GROUP BY target_id, fill_id
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
   ```

   Must return **zero rows**. Every distinct `Fill` produced exactly one row with exactly one `order_id`, regardless of which path observed it first. Decision discrepancies (poll saw it, WS missed, or vice versa) are **expected** and are logged via a `decision_paths_diverged` counter — they must not cause double-fires. 100 % decision agreement is NOT the gate (different observation windows naturally disagree on timing).

4. Delete `copyTradeMirror.job.ts`. Delete the SQL-backed dashboard card. File the env-fallback deprecation PR promised at P2 closeout.

**🎯 Phase 4 E2E validation (ONE scenario):**

> During the 48 h dual-run, every tracked wallet fill produces exactly ONE `poly_copy_trade_fills` row with exactly ONE `order_id` (cutover SQL above returns zero rows). The dashboard live feed (SSE path) renders the decision in <2 s of the WS-observed fill. Kill the WS activity mid-burst → the reconcile workflow XADDs the missed fills within 5 min; normal pipeline places them; no dedupe violation.

---

### ObservationEvents — deferred with named trigger

Do NOT land in any phase above. Land when the **second consumer** arrives (e.g., `poly-synth` cross-wallet analysis; a second domain like Kalshi copy-trade; a third-party analytics plug-in). Designing the schema against one use case produces the wrong schema. A ~50-line backfill reads `poly_copy_trade_fills` + `poly_copy_trade_decisions` to seed history at that time. A tracking work-item is filed at P2 closeout and linked from the awareness-plane spec.

---

**Reuses:**

- Existing `PolymarketAdapter` HTTP + retry (PR-A).
- Existing `MarketProviderPort` — Run methods were anticipated by the port's own header comment.
- Existing Privy operator wallet — gains Polygon EIP-712 typed-data signing; zero new key-custody surface.
- `@polymarket/clob-client` (MIT) — encapsulated behind the polymarket adapter.
- `@cogni/scheduler-core` — for the disposable P1/P2 poll.
- `@cogni/node-streams` + Temporal — arrive in P4 (gated on P3 evidence).
- Patterns (not code) from `Polymarket/agents` and `GiordanoSouza/polymarket-copy-trading-bot`.

**Rejected:**

- **Building the 3-tier streaming pipeline first.** Ships nothing in P1, blocks on Temporal worker wiring, over-designs stream event shapes before real fills have been observed, and commits the P4 complexity before P3 paper-PnL has proven the edge exists. Replaced by disposable-poll + stable-boundary approach per senior-architect review.
- **Paper-adapter body after streaming** (prior ordering). Rejected: P4's gate becomes "handful of $1 live orders", too noisy to base a 1.5-week investment decision on. Paper body moves before streaming so the 14-day soak becomes real evidence.
- **Env-var removal in the UI PR (P2).** Rejected per reviewer: P2's job is the UI surface; ripping out P1's working env path in the same change increases blast radius for no scope win. DB-authoritative-when-populated with env fallback ships in P2; env-removal is a separate deprecation PR.
- **"100 % decision agreement" as P4 cutover gate.** Rejected: poll and WS have different observation windows and will naturally disagree on timing/order; demanding 100 % agreement is unachievable. Replaced by idempotency gate: zero double-fires, exactly one `order_id` per `Fill`.
- **Extending `OperatorWalletPort` with `placePolymarketOrder`.** Wallet port stays for transfers; it gains `signPolymarketOrder` (a signer primitive). Order placement belongs on `MarketProviderPort`.
- **New `MarketExecutorPort` / `@cogni/market-executor` package.** `MarketProviderPort` was designed to grow Run methods; splitting read/write fragments credentials and provider abstraction.
- **`clob-executor.ts` importing the signer key directly.** Signing lives in the Privy adapter; `clob-executor` imports the narrow `PolymarketOrderSigner` via the container.
- **`DRY_RUN` flag as a conditional inside the live adapter.** Replaced by per-target `mode` column — adapter swap at the container boundary, no mixed identities.
- **Awareness-plane `ObservationEvent` insert in P1/P2/P3/P4.** Deferred with named trigger (above). Premature abstraction against a single consumer.
- **Self-attested legal-gate env var.** Trivially bypassable theater. Legal responsibility in the PR alignment-decisions checklist.
- **Separate `POLY_PROXY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` env var.** Privy HSM holds the key via `signPolymarketOrder`. No new key surface.
- Importing any Python OSS — different runtime, viral licenses where applicable.
- `poly_tracked_wallets` / weekly ranking batch — Data-API leaderboard is live.
- Category scoping, ranking sophistication — defer.

- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/ai/tool-bindings.ts` + `nodes/poly/graphs/src/graphs/poly-brain/tools.ts` — wiring.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_{api,components}/top-wallets*` + `page.tsx` — Top Wallets card.

### Files — by phase (v0.1)

**Phase 1 — First live order:**

- `packages/market-provider/src/port/market-provider.port.ts` — extend with `placeOrder` / `cancelOrder` / `getOrder`.
- `packages/market-provider/src/domain/order.ts` — `OrderIntent` / `OrderReceipt` / `OrderStatus` / `Fill` Zod schemas.
- `packages/market-provider/src/port/polymarket-order-signer.port.ts` — narrow `{ signPolymarketOrder(typedData): Promise<Hex> }`.
- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/` — Run methods via `@polymarket/clob-client`; signer + safe-proxy-address injected at construction.
- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/paper/` — interface scaffolded, body throws `NotImplemented`.
- `packages/operator-wallet/src/port/operator-wallet.port.ts` — add `signPolymarketOrder(typedData): Promise<Hex>`.
- `packages/operator-wallet/src/adapters/privy/privy-operator-wallet.adapter.ts` — implement for Polygon EIP-712 (parameterize chain scope: existing methods stay `BASE_CAIP2`, new method uses `POLYGON_CAIP2=eip155:137`).
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/decide.ts` — pure `decide()`, heavy unit tests.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/clob-executor.ts` — takes `MirrorIntent`, returns `{order_id}`. Dynamic-import-gated on `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/jobs/copyTradeMirror.job.ts` — `@scaffolding` / `Deleted-in-phase: 4`. 30 s poll → normalize → `decide()` → executor.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/copy-trade-activity-card.tsx` — `@scaffolding` / `Deleted-in-phase: 4`. SELECT-backed card.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/db/schema.ts` — add `poly_copy_trade_fills`, `poly_copy_trade_config`, `poly_copy_trade_decisions`. Migration header declares the Phase 0.2 `fill_id` shape.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/container.ts` — construct polymarket adapter with signer when `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`; other roles get read-only adapter whose `placeOrder` throws.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/env/server-env.ts` — add `POLY_ROLE`, `POLY_CLOB_*`, scaffolding `COPY_TRADE_*`.
- `.env.example` — document the above.
- Tests: unit tests on `decide()` (one per skip-reason branch + cap edges + idempotency); contract tests on the polymarket adapter Run methods against a recorded `@polymarket/clob-client` fixture; absence-of-module-load assertion for non-trader replicas.

**Phase 2 — Click-to-copy UI:**

- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/db/schema.ts` — add `poly_copy_trade_targets` (schema above). Migrate `poly_copy_trade_fills.target_id` FK to the new table (backfill synthetic UUIDs for any P1 rows).
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_api/copy-targets.ts` — server action CRUD, operator-role RBAC.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/top-wallets-card.tsx` — add "Copy" button per row.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/copy-targets-card.tsx` (new) — list, mode toggle, enable/disable, remove.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/target-resolver.ts` (new) — implements the DB-authoritative-when-populated rule; emits a warn log when env fallback fires.
- Closeout deliverable: a follow-up work-item filed to deprecate env fallback after P2 has been running cleanly for 1 week.
- Tests: integration test for the DB-vs-env fallback branching (both populated, DB empty + env set, both empty).

**Phase 3 — Paper-adapter body:**

- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/paper/` — body: pull book snapshot at `observed_at + N s`, write synthetic fill, return synthetic receipt.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/db/schema.ts` — add `paper_orders`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/paper-analysis.ts` (optional) — small utility that computes cumulative paper PnL vs tracked realized PnL for the 14-day soak report.
- Closeout deliverable: the paper-soak report with the Phase 4 gate decision (GO / NO-GO + numbers).

**Phase 4 — Streaming upgrade (gated on P3):**

- `nodes/poly/app/src/adapters/server/temporal/worker.ts` — new worker wiring for `POLY_ROLE=trader` (if P0.1 showed it missing).
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/activities/subscribePolymarketUserFills.activity.ts` — long-lived WS, normalizes frames to `Fill`, XADDs to `streams:copy-trade:polymarket-fills`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/activities/placeMirrorOrder.activity.ts` — calls existing `clob-executor`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/workflows/CopyTradeIngesterWorkflow.ts` — starts/cancels per-target WS activities on target enable/disable events.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/workflows/CopyTradeTriggerWorkflow.ts` — tails stream, calls `decide()`, signals `MirrorOrderWorkflow`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/workflows/MirrorOrderWorkflow.ts` — single-activity workflow.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/workflows/ReconcileFillsWorkflow.ts` — 5 min scheduled reconcile.
- `packages/market-provider/src/domain/node-events.ts` — `PolymarketFillObserved`, `CopyTradeDecisionMade` event types; poly NodeEvent union extended.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/copy-trade-activity-card.tsx` — swap SELECT for SSE-over-`/api/v1/node/stream` reader.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/jobs/copyTradeMirror.job.ts` — **DELETED** post-cutover.
- New deprecation PR filed for `COPY_TRADE_*` env-var fallback (promised at P2 closeout).

### Observability

- Every `decide()` outcome: Pino log + Prometheus `decisions_total{outcome, reason}` counter.
- Additional counters: `live_orders_total`, `cap_hit_total{dimension=daily|hourly}`, `env_fallback_in_use` (gauge, flips to 1 when P2 fallback fires).
- Grafana dashboard JSON: single panel group covering decisions by outcome, cap-hit rate, last-fill age, live-order throughput. Lands in Phase 2 (once the surface is stable).
- Poll-mechanism metrics are NOT instrumented. The scaffolding is disposable; dashboard panels for it would become tech debt.

### Secret boundary

- Signing key: Privy HSM only. Neither the market adapter nor app code sees raw key material. `signPolymarketOrder` is a named method on the wallet port.
- `signer_address` (EOA, holds no funds), `safe_proxy_address` (holds USDC.e, receives fills). Stored with the Privy wallet config; surfaced through the adapter.
- CLOB L2 credentials: env/vault across all phases, per operator directive. Only loaded when `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`.
- One-time manual ops (PR description, not automated): accept Polymarket ToS with the EOA, record the Safe proxy, fund the **proxy** with USDC.e, fund the EOA with a few POL for gas.

### Tests

Per-phase unit + integration tests are listed inline under each Phase's Files block above. Live CLOB placement is never exercised in CI — only in the Phase 1 controlled manual run, with the `order_id` pasted into the PR description as evidence.

### Historical — PR-A prep (now shipped)

- Leaderboard curl verified 2026-04-17 (no window param, no win-rate). Fixture saved at `docs/research/fixtures/polymarket-leaderboard.json`; ROI derived from `pnl/vol`.
- `@polymarket/clob-client` TS SDK verification — covered by PR-A's research doc linked above.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] STABLE_BOUNDARY: `decide()` is pure, zero I/O, and no phase after P1 modifies it — only grows its callers.
- [ ] DECIDE_NOT_DUPLICATED: poll (P1), DB-driven poll (P2), and Temporal trigger (P4) all call the same `decide()` module.
- [ ] CLOB_EXECUTOR_SOLE_SIGNER: `clob-executor.ts` is the only importer of the signer bridge and `@polymarket/clob-client`; dynamic-import-gated on `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`.
- [ ] SIGNER_VIA_PORT: market adapter depends only on the narrow `PolymarketOrderSigner` interface; no Privy or env imports.
- [ ] PORT_IS_EXISTING: Run-phase methods extend the existing `MarketProviderPort`; no new port package.
- [ ] SCAFFOLDING_LABELED: every disposable file's header states `@scaffolding` + `Deleted-in-phase: N`. Must include the phase number at which deletion occurs.
- [ ] DB_AUTHORITATIVE_WHEN_POPULATED (P2+): once `poly_copy_trade_targets` has ≥1 enabled row, the env fallback is NOT consulted; env only fires when DB is empty.
- [ ] ENV_FALLBACK_LOGGED (P2): every tick that consults env instead of DB emits a warn log + flips the `env_fallback_in_use` gauge to 1.
- [ ] ENV*REMOVAL_DEFERRED (P2): the `COPY_TRADE*\*` env vars are NOT removed in the same PR as the UI; a follow-up deprecation work-item is filed at P2 closeout.
- [ ] DEDUPE_PERSISTED: `poly_copy_trade_fills` PK `(target_id, fill_id)` is the commit point; in-memory dedupe is forbidden.
- [ ] GLOBAL_KILL_DB_ROW: flipping `poly_copy_trade_config.enabled=false` halts live placements within one poll/workflow cycle.
- [ ] PER_TARGET_KILL (P2+): `poly_copy_trade_targets.enabled=false` halts that target; `mode='paper'` routes through the paper adapter (body from P3 on).
- [ ] HARD_CAP_DAILY / HARD_CAP_HOURLY: enforced by `decide()` against `TargetConfig` caps.
- [ ] IDEMPOTENT_BY_CLIENT_ID: `client_order_id = hash(target_id || fill_id)`; CLOB dedupes at placement; PK dedupes at commit.
- [ ] DECIDE_OBSERVED: every `decide()` outcome emits Pino + `decisions_total{outcome, reason}`. Poll-mechanism metrics are NOT instrumented (tech-debt avoidance).
- [ ] FILL_ID_SHAPE_DECIDED: the Phase 1 migration header declares the canonical `fill_id` shape per P0.2: composite `"<source>:<native_id>"` where `source ∈ {data-api, clob-ws}` and `data-api` native_id = `${transactionHash}:${asset}:${side}`. No bilingual dedupe across phases.
- [ ] CLOB_SECRETS_MINIMAL_ENV: only CLOB L2 secrets + `POLY_ROLE` in env; no private keys.
- [ ] OBSERVATION_EVENTS_DEFERRED: no writes to `observation_events` from copy-trade code until the named second-consumer trigger fires.
- [ ] STREAM_THEN_EVALUATE (P4): every WS frame XADDs before trigger evaluation (spec: data-streams).
- [ ] TEMPORAL_OWNS_IO (P4): WS subscription + stream reads/writes + DB writes all in Temporal activities (spec: data-streams).
- [ ] TRIGGERS_ARE_PURE (P4): `CopyTradeTriggerWorkflow` is pure/replay-safe and calls `decide()` (spec: data-streams).
- [ ] CUTOVER_IDEMPOTENCY_GATE (P4): 48 h dual-run produces zero duplicate `(target_id, fill_id)` rows in `poly_copy_trade_fills`. Decision-path agreement is NOT the gate.

## Validation

**v0 (PR-A, shipped):**

- [x] `poly-brain` chat returns the ranked wallet list.
- [x] Dashboard Top Wallets card renders the live leaderboard.

**Phase 0 — Pre-flight gate (no code):**

- [x] `fill_id` shape + rationale recorded in Phase 0 — Findings (composite `"<source>:<native_id>"`; P1 migration header cites this verbatim).
- [x] Temporal-worker presence recorded: platform `scheduler-worker` runs; no poly-specific worker today. P4 adds one.

**🎯 Phase 1 — First live order:**

- [ ] With `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET=<target>`, `COPY_TRADE_MODE=live`, `poly_copy_trade_config.enabled=true`: within 60 s of the target's next real fill, a `poly_copy_trade_fills` row appears with non-null `order_id`; Polymarket web UI under the Cogni Safe proxy shows the open position. `order_id` + screenshot pasted into the PR.
- [ ] Flipping `poly_copy_trade_config.enabled=false` halts further placements within one poll cycle; no redeploy.
- [ ] Unit: `client_order_id` collision → adapter returns existing receipt without placing.
- [ ] Unit: daily + hourly caps block further placements once hit (one test per branch in `decide()`).
- [ ] Non-trader replica boots without loading `@polymarket/clob-client` or Privy Polygon signing (absence-of-module-load assertion).
- [ ] Every scaffolding file header contains `@scaffolding` + `Deleted-in-phase: 4`.

**🎯 Phase 2 — Click-to-copy UI:**

- [ ] Click "Copy" on the Top Wallets card → row in `poly_copy_trade_targets` with `mode='paper'` default.
- [ ] With ≥1 DB target, env is NOT consulted; `env_fallback_in_use` gauge = 0.
- [ ] With DB empty and env set, env fallback is used within one poll cycle; warn log + gauge = 1.
- [ ] Flipping `mode='live'` via the Copy Targets card → next fill produces a `poly_copy_trade_fills` row with non-null `order_id` within one poll cycle.
- [ ] "Remove" stops further placements for that target.
- [ ] Env-fallback deprecation work-item exists and is linked in the PR.

**🎯 Phase 3 — Paper-adapter body:**

- [ ] Every tracked fill on a `mode='paper'` target produces a `paper_orders` row within 10 s of `observed_at` for 14 continuous days.
- [ ] Cumulative paper PnL is within the pre-declared tolerance band (e.g. ±30 %) of the target's realized PnL; PnL correlation > 0.8.
- [ ] Phase 4 GO/NO-GO decision is recorded in the closeout doc with numbers.

**🎯 Phase 4 — Streaming upgrade (only if P3 gate = GO):**

- [ ] 48 h dual-run: the cutover SQL query `SELECT target_id, fill_id, COUNT(*) FROM poly_copy_trade_fills WHERE decided_at > <dual_run_start> GROUP BY 1,2 HAVING COUNT(*) > 1` returns zero rows.
- [ ] Dashboard SSE path renders a decision in <2 s of the WS-observed fill.
- [ ] Kill WS activity mid-burst → reconcile workflow XADDs missed fills within 5 min; normal pipeline places them; no dedupe violation.
- [ ] Post-cutover: `copyTradeMirror.job.ts` deleted; SQL-backed dashboard card deleted; env-fallback deprecation PR opened.

**Overall merge gate (every phase PR):**

- [ ] `pnpm check` passes.

**Post-merge sign-off (tracked separately, not a merge gate):**

- After Phase 3 completes, the paper-soak report is the authoritative record of whether Phase 4 should be built. No edge → feature sunsets at P3; Phase 4 is not started.

## Out of Scope (push back if scope creeps)

- `ObservationEvent(kind=polymarket_wallet_trade)` / `poly-synth` cross-wallet analysis — deferred with named trigger (second consumer).
- `poly_tracked_wallets` / weekly ranking batch — Data-API leaderboard is live.
- Category scoping, survivorship-bias guards beyond Data-API defaults.
- `poly-brain` cite-wallet tool (citation DAG into knowledge plane).
- Goldsky subgraph / Polygon block-listener — CLOB WS (in P4) is sufficient.
- Multi-user / retail-facing mirroring — single-operator only (see Alignment Decisions).
- Per-strategy attribution across proxies; operator-wallet integration.
- Slippage modeling beyond the P3 paper-soak comparison.
- Env-var removal in the same PR as the P2 UI change — filed as a separate deprecation PR after P2.

Any requests here mid-flight → new follow-up task.

## Review Feedback (revision 1, 2026-04-16)

Phase 0 findings are directionally sound but have substantive issues that will bite P1's migration and P4's cutover. Fix before `/implement P1`:

1. **`fill_id` composite is not unique** (L167–172). `polymarket.data-api.types.ts` declares `transactionHash: z.string().optional().default("")`. Empty-hash rows collapse to `data-api::<asset>:<side>` → PK violation silently drops fills. Multi-match settlements within one tx also share `(tx, asset, side)`. Decide between (a) include `timestamp` in `native_id`, or (b) reject/repair rows with empty `transactionHash`. Commit the final shape — with rationale for uniqueness — in the P1 migration header.

2. **P4 cutover SQL is vacuous** (L281–287, L441). Composite prefixes make DA and WS rows different PKs for the same logical match, so `GROUP BY target_id, fill_id HAVING COUNT(*)>1` is unreachable by the unique constraint. Combined with the observe-only amendment, only WS inserts non-null `order_id`s — "zero double-placements" holds by construction and proves nothing. Replace with a cross-source join on `(target_wallet, conditionId, side, timestamp ± Δ)` and assert ≤1 non-null `order_id` per logical match, or make the gate `decision_paths_diverged` bounded + WS-order count ≈ DA-observed count within tolerance.

3. **`decision_paths_diverged` counter referenced but not declared** (L176, L289 vs L395–398). Add it to the Observability section's counter list.

4. **`decisions_total` needs a dual-run label** (L395). Without `mode=active|observe_only` (or equivalent), observe-only DA decisions double-count during the 48 h window, breaking any dashboard keyed on the counter.

5. **`OBSERVE_ONLY_DUAL_RUN_P4` invariant missing** (L418–442). The executor-not-invoked amendment is the only mechanism preventing double-placement during dual-run. Prose is insufficient — add an invariant mandating that `clob-executor` is invoked solely from the WS path during dual-run, and that the DA poll records decisions without placing.

6. **`FILL_ID_SHAPE_DECIDED` must mandate a P4 header commit** (L435). Current wording decides only the data-api shape. Add a clause requiring the P4 migration header to commit the final `clob-ws` native_id shape before the WS ingester activity lands.

7. **Stale conditional phrasing** (L267, L381). "(if P0.1 showed it was missing)" — P0.1 is definitive. Replace with a direct statement.

Non-blocking: in P4 reconcile prose, pre-commit the cross-source join key (likely `(target_wallet, conditionId, side, size, timestamp ± Δ)`) so the reconcile activity has an unambiguous target when implemented.

## Alignment Decisions (confirmed by operator before `/implement`)

- **Single-operator prototype.** No user-facing mirroring, no retail exposure, no multi-tenant. Scope expansion requires re-scoping in a new task.
- **Legal responsibility is the operator's**, tracked in the PR description's alignment-decisions checklist, not an env-var gate.
- **Key custody is Privy HSM.** No private-key env var. `signer_address` is the Privy-managed EOA; `safe_proxy_address` is the Polymarket Safe proxy. Rotation plan is Privy's standard HSM rotation.

## Notes on "is this worth productizing?"

The Phase 3 paper soak answers this with real numbers, not hypotheticals. Run P3 for 14 days on candidate wallets; if no wallet shows positive slippage-adjusted edge, the feature sunsets at P3 and Phase 4 (streaming) is not built. If it does survive, Phase 4 ships the realtime path.

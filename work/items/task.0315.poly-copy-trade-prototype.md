title: "Poly copy-trade prototype — v0 top-wallet scoreboard, v0.1 shadow 1-wallet mirror"
status: needs_closeout
priority: 2
estimate: 5
rank: 5
branch: research/poly-copy-trading-wallets
summary: "One-shot prototype task. v0 (PR-A, this PR): poly-brain + dashboard answer 'who are the top Polymarket wallets?' via a new core__wallet_top_traders tool + /dashboard Top Wallets card backed by the Polymarket Data API. v0.1 (PR-B, not in this PR): single-wallet shadow mirror via @polymarket/clob-client. No new packages, no ports, no ranking pipeline, no awareness-plane tables. If it works, we scale it; if it doesn't, we learned cheaply."
outcome: "A running prototype in the poly node: (v0) ask poly-brain 'top wallets this week' and get a ranked, scored list inline in chat; (v0.1) set ONE tracked wallet via env/config, a 30-second poller detects new fills, a mirror order is placed on Polymarket via @polymarket/clob-client with a small fixed USDC size. All behind a DRY_RUN flag until we trust it."

# Poly Copy-Trade Prototype

> Research: [poly-copy-trading-wallets](../../docs/research/poly-copy-trading-wallets.md)

> Project: [proj.poly-prediction-bot](../projects/proj.poly-prediction-bot.md)

## Plan (PR-A checkpoints)

- [x] **Checkpoint 1 — market-provider Data-API client** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `PolymarketDataApiClient` class in `@cogni/market-provider`, verified against the saved fixture.
  - Invariants: PACKAGES_NO_ENV, READ_ONLY, CONTRACT_IS_SOT.
  - Todos: new `polymarket.data-api.types.ts` (Zod schemas) + `polymarket.data-api.client.ts` (class), extend barrel.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F @cogni/market-provider test` + fixture-driven parsing test.

- [x] **Checkpoint 2 — ai-tools `core__wallet_top_traders`** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: bound tool + stub registered in `TOOL_CATALOG`, passes schema tests.
  - Invariants: TOOL_ID_NAMESPACED, EFFECT_TYPED, REDACTION_REQUIRED, NO_LANGCHAIN.
  - Todos: new `tools/wallet-top-traders.ts`, extend `index.ts` exports + `catalog.ts`.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F @cogni/ai-tools test`.

- [x] **Checkpoint 3 — poly node wiring** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `createWalletCapability` + tool binding + `POLY_BRAIN_TOOL_IDS` entry live in the container.
  - Invariants: CAPABILITY_INJECTION, SCOPE_IS_SACRED.
  - Todos: new `bootstrap/capabilities/wallet.ts`; update `container.ts`, `tool-bindings.ts`, `poly-brain/tools.ts`.
  - Validation: `pnpm -F poly-app typecheck` + unit test on the factory.

- [x] **Checkpoint 4 — dashboard "Top Wallets" card** ✅ PR-A
  - Milestone: `/dashboard` renders a live top-10 table with a DAY/WEEK/MONTH/ALL selector.
  - Invariants: SIMPLE_SOLUTION, CAPABILITY_NOT_ADAPTER in the API route.
  - Todos: new `/api/v1/poly/top-wallets/route.ts`, `_api/fetchTopWallets.ts`, `_components/TopWalletsCard.tsx`; modify `view.tsx`.
  - Validation: `pnpm check` clean; manual hit of the API route in dev confirms live data.

## Context

Research (spike.0314) mapped the OSS and data landscape. Rather than decompose into five follow-ups, this single task ships a working prototype in two increments and stops. If the prototype proves the idea, we write real tasks with real specs. If it doesn't, we kill the feature with minimum sunk cost.

## Design

### Outcome

Two working increments, shipped as **two PRs under this one task**:

- **v0 (PR-A, read-only, merges independently) — scoreboard, chat + dashboard:**
  - user asks `poly-brain` "who are the top Polymarket wallets right now?" → agent calls a new `core__wallet_top_traders` tool → scored list with wallet / PnL / win-rate / volume / activity score rendered as a markdown table in chat.
  - `/(app)/dashboard` gets a new "Top Wallets" card — server-component table of the top ~10 wallets with the same columns, backed by the same `WalletCapability`.
- **v0.1 (PR-B, behind feature flag) — shadow mirror of one wallet:** operator sets one target wallet in config. A 30-second scheduler-core job detects new fills, decides a mirror order, and — **only if every guard passes** — places it via `@polymarket/clob-client` from a Cogni-owned proxy wallet. Default mode is `DRY_RUN=true` (shadow): decisions logged and persisted, no CLOB call. Live mode requires flipping both a DB kill-switch row AND the env var.

### Approach

**Solution:** port patterns from `Polymarket/agents` + `GiordanoSouza/polymarket-copy-trading-bot` (see research doc). TS-only, no Python. Three pieces:

1. **Polymarket Data-API calls** — three thin methods on the existing `PolymarketAdapter`: `listTopTraders`, `listUserActivity`, `listUserPositions`. No new port, no new package.
2. **v0 scoreboard tool** — one new LangGraph tool `core__wallet_top_traders` cloned from the `core__market_list` shape (`packages/ai-tools/src/tools/market-list.ts`). Activity score = simple blend of PnL × win-rate × log(volume); premature to over-engineer.
3. **v0.1 mirror loop** — a `@cogni/scheduler-core` job registered under `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/jobs/copyTradeMirror.job.ts`, mirroring the shipped `syncGovernanceSchedules.job.ts` pattern. Every 30 s it polls `listUserActivity(TARGET_WALLET)`, dedupes against a new Postgres table `poly_copy_trade_fills(wallet, fill_id, decided_at, order_id)` (PK `(wallet, fill_id)`), decides a mirror order with **fixed-USDC sizing** (`MIRROR_USDC` per fill — _not_ proportional to the tracked wallet; chosen as the simpler of the two products), and for each new fill calls `@polymarket/clob-client` if and only if every guard passes. Guards: `DRY_RUN` default `true`, DB-row kill switch `poly_copy_trade_config.live_enabled`, `pg_advisory_lock` for single-writer safety, hard daily USDC cap, hard fills-per-hour cap, legal-gate env assertion. Feature flag: job inert unless `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET` is set. Private-key load gated on `process.env.POLY_ROLE === 'trader'` so web replicas never hold the signer key.

**Reuses:**

- Existing `PolymarketAdapter` HTTP + retry.
- Existing `MarketCapability` / `core__market_list` pattern — clone it.
- `@polymarket/clob-client` (TS, MIT, first-party) for order placement.
- Patterns (not code) from `Polymarket/agents` (module split) and `GiordanoSouza/polymarket-copy-trading-bot` (poll → dedupe → sizing → place).

**Rejected:**

- New `WalletProviderPort` / new package / new spec — premature; one provider, one prototype.
- Awareness-plane `ObservationEvent(kind=polymarket_wallet_trade)` — unnecessary for a one-wallet prototype. Add it when we need N wallets + `poly-synth` analysis.
- `poly_tracked_wallets` table / weekly ranking batch — unnecessary; v0 returns the Data-API leaderboard live.
- Importing any Python OSS — different runtime, viral licenses where applicable.
- Goldsky subgraph / block-listener — Data API is sufficient at prototype scale.
- Multi-wallet, category scoping, ranking sophistication — defer until v0.1 proves edge exists.
- Real money by default — `DRY_RUN=true` until explicitly flipped.

### Files

**v0 scoreboard (new, small):**

- `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/data-api.ts` — three Data-API methods + Zod schemas.
- `packages/ai-tools/src/tools/wallet-top-traders.ts` — `core__wallet_top_traders` tool; return shape is a markdown table string so chat renders cleanly without bespoke formatting.
- `packages/ai-tools/src/index.ts` — export the tool id + `WalletCapability` interface.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/wallet.ts` — capability resolver delegating to the adapter.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/ai/tool-bindings.ts` — bind the new tool.
- `nodes/poly/graphs/src/graphs/poly-brain/tools.ts` — add to `POLY_BRAIN_TOOL_IDS`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_components/top-wallets-card.tsx` — server component, renders the top ~10 wallets in a table (existing dashboard-card pattern).
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/_api/top-wallets.ts` — reads `WalletCapability` from the container, returns a typed DTO to the card. Keeps dashboard layer out of adapter imports.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx` — slot the new card into the existing grid.

**v0.1 mirror (new, small — follows existing `bootstrap/jobs/*.job.ts` + `@cogni/scheduler-core` pattern):**

- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/mirror-service.ts` — pure domain logic: persisted-dedupe query, sizing (fixed USDC), daily-cap check, fills-per-hour check, legal-gate check, kill-switch check → emits a `MirrorDecision` (`place` / `skip-reason`). No I/O beyond the one dedupe-table query.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/clob-executor.ts` — thin wrapper around `@polymarket/clob-client`. **Only** importer of the clob client and the proxy-wallet private key. Module loads via lazy dynamic `import()` gated on `process.env.POLY_ROLE === 'trader'` so web / scheduler-sync replicas never materialize the key in memory. No-ops under `DRY_RUN=true`.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/jobs/copyTradeMirror.job.ts` — `scheduler-core` job, polls `listUserActivity(TARGET_WALLET)` every 30 s, persists every decision (placed or skipped) with reason to Pino + a `poly_copy_trade_decisions` log table, acquires `pg_advisory_lock` to ensure single-writer.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/db/schema.ts` — add two tables:
  - `poly_copy_trade_fills (wallet text, fill_id text, decided_at timestamptz, order_id text null, PRIMARY KEY (wallet, fill_id))` — the dedupe source of truth.
  - `poly_copy_trade_config (singleton_id int PK = 1, live_enabled boolean not null default false, updated_at timestamptz, updated_by text)` — the runtime kill switch, must be `true` AND `DRY_RUN=false` for a real order to place.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/shared/env/server-env.ts` — add `COPY_TRADE_TARGET_WALLET`, `COPY_TRADE_MIRROR_USDC`, `COPY_TRADE_DRY_RUN` (default `true`), `COPY_TRADE_MAX_DAILY_USDC`, `COPY_TRADE_MAX_FILLS_PER_HOUR`, `COPY_TRADE_OPERATOR_JURISDICTION` (must be set; checked against a block-list), `POLY_ROLE`.
- `.env.example` — document the new env vars.

**Observability (in scope, not deferred):**

- One Pino log per job tick with (new_fills, skipped_reason_counts, placed_count, cap_remaining).
- Prometheus counters: `poly_copy_trade_fills_seen_total`, `poly_copy_trade_decisions_total{outcome=placed|skipped|error, reason=...}`, `poly_copy_trade_live_orders_total`, `poly_copy_trade_cap_hit_total{dimension=daily|hourly}`.
- One new Grafana dashboard JSON checked in alongside the code (single panel group: tick rate, decisions by outcome, cap-hit rate, last-fill-age). Without this the 2-week shadow soak has nothing to watch. ~20 min of work.
- `poly_copy_trade_decisions` log table includes a **shadow `proportional_size_usdc` column** that records what proportional sizing would have decided, even though we act on fixed USDC. Preserves the option to re-analyze the soak data without a second run.

**Secret boundary (proxy-wallet keys):**

- `POLY_PROXY_WALLET_ADDRESS` — on-chain proxy wallet holding USDC.e on Polygon (public).
- `POLY_PROXY_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY` — the EOA private key that signs CLOB orders. **Loaded only inside `clob-executor.ts` via `serverEnv`. Never crosses into tool code, graph code, or any capability.**
- `POLY_CLOB_API_KEY` / `POLY_CLOB_API_SECRET` / `POLY_CLOB_PASSPHRASE` — CLOB API credentials if Polymarket requires the L2 auth flow.
- Manual one-time setup (documented in the PR, not automated): create the proxy wallet, sign Polymarket ToS, fund with USDC.e. Not in scope to automate for a prototype.

**Tests:**

- Contract tests for the three adapter methods (fixture-based).
- One stack test asserting `poly-brain` can invoke `core__wallet_top_traders` end-to-end.
- Unit tests for mirror-service: persisted dedupe, daily cap, hourly cap, legal gate, kill-switch — one test per skip-reason branch.
- Integration test: a full tick in shadow mode inserts a `poly_copy_trade_fills` row and does NOT import `@polymarket/clob-client`.
- No live CLOB call in CI. The `DRY_RUN=false` path is exercised manually once, in a controlled run, and the `order_id` pasted into the PR description as evidence.

**Pre-PR-A prep (~1 hour, zero code — do this first):**

- **Leaderboard curl — DONE 2026-04-17:** `GET https://data-api.polymarket.com/v1/leaderboard` → 200, array of `{rank, proxyWallet, userName, xUsername, verifiedBadge, vol, pnl, profileImage}`. No window param honored (tested `window=`, `period=`, `timeRange=`, `interval=` — all return identical bytes). No win-rate field. **Implication for v0:** drop `activityScore = PnL × winRate × log(vol)` from the design; use `ROI = pnl/vol × 100` as the primary rank metric, with `vol` + `pnl` displayed alongside. Fixture saved at `docs/research/fixtures/polymarket-leaderboard.json` — use it as the stack-test fixture directly.
- **Clob-client TS SDK verification (30 min, no code):** **moved here from PR-B prep.** Read `@polymarket/clob-client` source + README and confirm: (a) proxy-wallet signing end-to-end in TS, (b) L2 API-key auth path exists, (c) `NegRiskAdapter` / multi-outcome markets are addressable. If any gap, either scope v0.1 to single-outcome markets or fall back to `viem` + `@polymarket/order-utils` for raw EIP-712. Record the outcome in a short note under `docs/research/` and reference it from the PR-B description. Doing this before PR-A because a SDK gap changes the shape of `clob-executor.ts` enough to re-inform PR-A's capability boundaries.
- **Tool-output rendering check (5 min):** send a sample markdown table through the existing poly-brain tool-output path to confirm chat renders it cleanly. If it doesn't, the tool returns structured JSON and the app does the rendering on the dashboard side — adjust before writing the tool schema.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] TS_ONLY_RUNTIME: no Python, no IPC, no new runtime
- [ ] NO_NEW_PACKAGE: all new code lives in existing `packages/market-provider`, `packages/ai-tools`, or `nodes/poly/app`
- [ ] NO_NEW_PORT_PACKAGE: no new `packages/*-port` — a `WalletCapability` interface exported from `packages/ai-tools` alongside `MarketCapability` is OK; a full port package is not
- [ ] CONTRACT_IS_SOT: Zod schemas for Data-API + tool input/output (spec: architecture)
- [ ] CAPABILITY_NOT_ADAPTER: the tool imports the capability interface, not the adapter
- [ ] TOOL_ID_NAMESPACED: `core__wallet_top_traders`, `effect: read_only` (spec: architecture)
- [ ] DRY_RUN_DEFAULT: `COPY_TRADE_DRY_RUN` defaults to `true`; real trades require an explicit flip
- [ ] DEDUPE_PERSISTED: dedupe via `poly_copy_trade_fills` Postgres table keyed `(wallet, fill_id)`, NOT in-memory — restart crash does not double-fire
- [ ] KILL_SWITCH_DB_ROW: a real order requires `poly_copy_trade_config.live_enabled = true` AND `DRY_RUN=false` — an operator flips the DB row to halt instantly without redeploy
- [ ] HARD_CAP_DAILY: job enforces `COPY_TRADE_MAX_DAILY_USDC`
- [ ] HARD_CAP_HOURLY: job enforces `COPY_TRADE_MAX_FILLS_PER_HOUR`
- [ ] LEGAL_GATE: `COPY_TRADE_OPERATOR_JURISDICTION` must be set and not in the block-list (`US` included) for any live order; shadow mode runs regardless
- [ ] KEY_IN_TRADER_ROLE_ONLY: `clob-executor.ts` loads the proxy-wallet private key only when `POLY_ROLE === 'trader'`; web / other-role replicas never materialize it (dynamic import boundary)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: port patterns from OSS references; no ranking pipeline, no awareness-plane tables (spec: architecture)
- [ ] SIMPLE_OVER_GENERIC: one target wallet, one sizing rule (fixed USDC per fill), one proxy wallet — no multi-tenancy
- [ ] SCHEDULER_CORE_FOR_BACKGROUND: v0.1 loop runs as a `bootstrap/jobs/*.job.ts` via `@cogni/scheduler-core`, not a bespoke `setInterval` (spec: architecture)
- [ ] SINGLE_WRITER: job acquires `pg_advisory_lock` so multi-replica deployments don't double-fire (mirrors `syncGovernanceSchedules.job.ts`)
- [ ] SECRETS_STAY_IN_EXECUTOR: the proxy-wallet private key is imported only by `clob-executor.ts`; tool code, capability code, and the graph never touch it (spec: architecture)
- [ ] LLM_STAYS_IN_GRAPH: the mirror loop contains no LLM calls; v0 scoreboard reasoning happens in `poly-brain` via the tool (spec: langgraph-patterns)
- [ ] OBSERVABILITY_COMMITMENT: every decision (placed / skipped-reason / error) emits a Pino log and increments a Prometheus counter (spec: architecture)

## Validation

**v0:**

- [ ] `poly-brain` chat: "show me the top 10 Polymarket wallets this week" returns a ranked list with PnL + win-rate + volume + activity score
- [ ] Stack test exercises the tool end-to-end against a recorded fixture
- [ ] Contract test covers malformed Data-API response (fails closed)

**v0.1 (merge gates — all must pass before PR-B merges):**

- [ ] With `DRY_RUN=true` and a live target wallet, the job persists a `MirrorDecision(outcome=shadow)` row within ≤60 s of a real fill on that wallet
- [ ] With `DRY_RUN=false` + `live_enabled=true` in a controlled run, a real mirror order is placed on Polymarket for `MIRROR_USDC` and the `order_id` is persisted in `poly_copy_trade_fills`
- [ ] Flipping `poly_copy_trade_config.live_enabled = false` stops further live orders within one poll cycle, no redeploy required
- [ ] Unit test: restarting mid-burst does not double-fire — dedupe-table insert is the commit point
- [ ] Unit test: daily USDC cap blocks further orders once hit
- [ ] Unit test: hourly fills cap blocks further orders once hit
- [ ] Unit test: legal-gate rejects when `COPY_TRADE_OPERATOR_JURISDICTION` is in the block-list
- [ ] Replica without `POLY_ROLE=trader` starts cleanly and does NOT materialize the signer key in memory (tested by an absence-of-module-load assertion)

**Overall merge gate:**

- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

**Post-merge sign-off (NOT a merge gate — tracked separately):**

- After PR-B merges, run a 2-week `DRY_RUN=true` shadow soak against one well-chosen wallet. Compare shadow-decision PnL against the target wallet's realized PnL at `observed_at + 5 s` book prices. If slippage-adjusted edge survives, create real follow-up tasks with evidence. If not, revert the `live_enabled` path and leave v0 in place.

## Out of Scope (explicitly — push back if scope creeps)

- Multi-wallet tracking
- `poly_tracked_wallets` table, weekly ranking batch
- `ObservationEvent(kind=polymarket_wallet_trade)` / poly-synth analysis
- Category scoping, survivorship-bias guards beyond the Data-API defaults
- `poly-brain` cite-wallet tool (citation DAG into knowledge plane)
- Goldsky subgraph, CLOB WebSocket, Polygon block-listener
- Real-money default; multi-user / retail-facing mirroring
- Per-strategy attribution across proxies; operator-wallet integration
- Slippage modeling beyond a live-book sanity check in the mirror log

If any of these get requested mid-flight, create a follow-up task instead of expanding this one.

## Alignment Decisions (confirmed by operator before `/implement`)

- **Operator jurisdiction:** this prototype operates **single-operator only** — no user-facing mirroring, no retail exposure, no multi-tenant. The `LEGAL_GATE` invariant guards the operator's jurisdiction, not end-users'. Scope expansion requires explicit re-scoping in a new task.
- **Proxy-wallet key custody:** before PR-B merges, the PR description must name (a) the human who holds the proxy-wallet private key, (b) where it lives (password manager / secrets vault / env file on one machine), (c) the rotation plan. "We'll figure it out later" is not acceptable for a key that signs on-chain transactions from a Cogni-controlled wallet.

## Notes on v0.1 → "is this worth productizing?"

Run v0.1 in `DRY_RUN=true` for 2 weeks against one well-chosen wallet (e.g. a top-30d trader in a single category). Compare hypothetical mirror PnL (fills would have happened at the live book at `observed_at + 5 s`) against the target wallet's realized PnL. If the ratio is poor, slippage kills the feature — stop. If it's decent, write the real follow-up tasks with evidence in hand.

summary: "Codex SDK's findCodexPath() resolves @openai/codex from the bundled standalone copy (pruned, no native binary) instead of the global pnpm install. Every ChatGPT BYO chat in preview fails with MODULE_NOT_FOUND."
outcome: "ChatGPT BYO chat works in preview. Codex SDK resolves the native binary from the global install, not the pruned standalone bundle."

# Codex binary MODULE_NOT_FOUND in Docker standalone

## Requirements

### Observed

Every ChatGPT BYO chat request in preview fails with:

```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/node_modules/.pnpm/@openai+codex@0.116.0/node_modules/@openai/codex/bin/codex.js'
  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```

Confirmed from Grafana Cloud logs at `2026-03-28T17:51:48Z` — 14 hours after latest deploy of sha `6c870b25` which contains the "fix."

### Expected

ChatGPT BYO chat works. Codex SDK spawns the native binary from the global pnpm install at `/usr/local/share/pnpm/`.

### Root Cause

**Resolution chain (3 layers deep):**

1. **App code** (`codex-llm.adapter.ts:153`): `const codexBin = existsSync(devBin) ? devBin : "codex"` — resolves to `"codex"` in Docker. Passes as `codexPathOverride`.

2. **Codex SDK** (`@openai/codex-sdk/dist/index.js:152-158`):

   ```js
   var moduleRequire = createRequire(import.meta.url);
   // import.meta.url = the BUNDLED SDK inside .next/standalone
   ```

   `CodexExec` constructor: `this.executablePath = executablePath || findCodexPath()`. With our `"codex"` override, it uses `"codex"` as the spawn target.

3. **Global shim** (`/usr/local/share/pnpm/codex`): The global pnpm shim spawns `node` which tries to `require("@openai/codex/bin/codex.js")`. Node resolves `@openai/codex` by walking from CWD (`/app`) → finds the **pruned** copy in `.next/standalone/node_modules` → binary not there → `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

**Why the global install doesn't help**: Next.js standalone bundles `@openai/codex-sdk` into the app output (it's not in `serverExternalPackages`). The bundled SDK's `createRequire(import.meta.url)` resolves from the standalone directory, not the global store. Even the global shim fails because Node's module resolution from CWD finds the pruned copy first.

### Fix

Add `@openai/codex-sdk` and `@openai/codex` to `serverExternalPackages` in `next.config.ts`:

```ts
serverExternalPackages: [
  // ... existing entries ...
  // Codex: subprocess binary — standalone tracing prunes native platform deps
  "@openai/codex-sdk",
  "@openai/codex",
  "@openai/codex-linux-x64",
],
```

This tells Next.js standalone to NOT bundle these packages. At runtime, Node resolves them from the global pnpm install (on PATH via `PNPM_HOME`), where the native `@openai/codex-linux-x64` binary is intact.

The adapter code (`codex-llm.adapter.ts`) can then be simplified — don't pass `codexPathOverride` at all and let the SDK's `findCodexPath()` work naturally from the global install context.

### Prior Attempts (both failed)

**PR #648 — Copy binaries to `/opt/codex/`:**
Copied `node_modules/@openai/codex` to `/opt/codex`, pointed adapter at `/opt/codex/bin/codex.js`.
Failed because `codex.js` is a Node wrapper that `require("@openai/codex-linux-x64")` — the platform optional dep wasn't copied. Same `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` one layer deeper.

**PR #650 — Global pnpm install + `"codex"` shim fallback:**
`pnpm add -g @openai/codex`, adapter falls back to `"codex"` string.
Failed for two compounding reasons: (1) the pnpm global shim resolves `@openai/codex` from CWD `/app` — finds the pruned standalone copy, not the global store. (2) The SDK itself is bundled into standalone; its `createRequire(import.meta.url)` resolves from the standalone dir, finding pruned packages.

**Why `serverExternalPackages` is the correct fix:** Both attempts addressed binary PATH resolution but missed the root cause — Next.js standalone bundles the SDK and prunes platform deps. The fix tells standalone to NOT bundle these packages, so runtime resolution hits the global install where platform binaries are intact. Identical pattern to `dockerode`, `ssh2`, `tigerbeetle-node` already in `next.config.ts:13-17`.

### Impact

- **Severity**: P0 — all ChatGPT BYO chat is broken in preview (and would be in production)
- **Scope**: Only codex provider. Platform (LiteLLM) and local (OpenAI-compatible) are unaffected.
- **Since**: First deploy with codex support

## Allowed Changes

- `apps/web/next.config.ts` — add codex packages to `serverExternalPackages`
- `apps/web/src/adapters/server/ai/codex/codex-llm.adapter.ts` — simplify binary resolution (remove `existsSync` fallback, let SDK resolve)
- `apps/web/Dockerfile` — verify global install path is correct (may already be fine)

## Plan

- [ ] Add `@openai/codex-sdk`, `@openai/codex`, `@openai/codex-linux-x64` to `serverExternalPackages`
- [ ] Remove manual binary resolution from adapter — let SDK's `findCodexPath()` handle it
- [ ] Verify `pnpm docker:stack` builds and codex chat works locally
- [ ] Push and verify preview deploy

## Validation

**Command:**

```bash
pnpm docker:stack
# Then send a ChatGPT BYO chat message
```

**Expected:** Codex spawns successfully. No `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Chat response arrives.

**Log check:** No `Cannot find module` errors in `docker logs cogni-app`.

# Typed Temporal Pipeline Composition

## Problem

`CollectEpochWorkflow` is a 10-step sequential monolith (227 lines). Adding, reordering, or conditionally skipping stages requires editing one large function. Activity proxy configs (timeout/retry) are copy-pasted across 3 workflows (5 `proxyActivities` blocks total). There is no way to reuse a pipeline stage (e.g., "just run enrichment") from a different workflow context.

This blocks rapid iteration on increasingly complex workflows — each new workflow will duplicate proxy configs and inline activity sequences rather than composing from tested stages.

## Design

### Outcome

Attribution workflows compose from typed, reusable child workflows. `CollectEpochWorkflow` becomes a thin orchestrator calling `CollectSourcesWorkflow` and `EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow` via `executeChild()`. Shared proxy configs eliminate retry duplication. Stage I/O types enforce compile-time safety at workflow boundaries.

### Approach

**Solution**: Three focused deliverables, all within `services/scheduler-worker/`:

#### Rock 1 — Shared Activity Proxy Configs

Extract `proxyActivities` timeout/retry configs into named profiles:

```typescript
// workflows/activity-profiles.ts
export const STANDARD_ACTIVITY_OPTIONS = {
  startToCloseTimeout: "2 minutes",
  retry: {
    initialInterval: "2 seconds",
    maximumInterval: "1 minute",
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumAttempts: 5,
  },
} as const satisfies ActivityOptions;

export const EXTERNAL_API_ACTIVITY_OPTIONS = {
  startToCloseTimeout: "5 minutes",
  retry: {
    initialInterval: "5 seconds",
    maximumInterval: "2 minutes",
    backoffCoefficient: 2,
    maximumAttempts: 3,
  },
} as const satisfies ActivityOptions;

export const GRAPH_EXECUTION_ACTIVITY_OPTIONS = {
  startToCloseTimeout: "15 minutes",
  retry: { maximumAttempts: 1 },
} as const satisfies ActivityOptions;
```

Share only the configs that are actually duplicated (2-min standard and 5-min external API appear 3+ times). Workflow-specific configs stay inline with a comment explaining why they differ. `scheduled-run.workflow.ts` keeps its 1-minute timeout inline (grant validation is intentionally fast-fail). `finalize-epoch.workflow.ts` keeps `maximumAttempts: 3` inline (intentionally lower than standard's 5). The goal is DRY, not forced uniformity.

#### Rock 2 — Child Workflow Decomposition

Split `CollectEpochWorkflow` into composable child workflows:

**`CollectSourcesWorkflow`** — the triple-nested collection loop (sources × sourceRefs × streams). Receives epoch context, returns `Promise<void>` (fire-and-forget — add a return type when something consumes it). This is the longest-running stage and benefits most from independent retry/visibility.

**`EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow`** — materializeSelection → evaluateEpochDraft → computeAllocations. Three sequential activities that always run together. Returns `Promise<void>`. Reusable by future "re-enrich" or "manual recalculate" workflows.

**Pool/close stays inline** in the parent — it's conditional and terminal, not worth a child workflow.

The parent `CollectEpochWorkflow` becomes:

```typescript
export async function CollectEpochWorkflow(raw: ScheduleActionPayload) {
  // Steps 1-4: setup (unchanged — window, weights, epoch)
  // ...
  if (epoch.status !== "open") return;

  // Step 5: collect from all sources
  await executeChild(CollectSourcesWorkflow, {
    args: [
      { epochId, sources: config.activitySources, periodStart, periodEnd },
    ],
    workflowId: `collect-sources-${epoch.epochId}`,
    parentClosePolicy: ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE,
  });

  // Steps 6-8: enrich and allocate
  await executeChild(EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow, {
    args: [{ epochId, attributionPipeline, weightConfig: epoch.weightConfig }],
    workflowId: `enrich-allocate-${epoch.epochId}`,
    parentClosePolicy: ParentClosePolicy.PARENT_CLOSE_POLICY_TERMINATE,
  });

  // Steps 9-10: pool + auto-close (inline, conditional)
  // (unchanged)
}
```

**Child workflow options:**

- `parentClosePolicy: TERMINATE` — if parent is cancelled (e.g., schedule overlap skip), terminate the child. Children should not outlive the parent orchestrator.
- No child-level retry — child failures propagate immediately to parent. The parent workflow's own retry policy (from the schedule) handles end-to-end retries.
- `workflowId` is stable per epoch for idempotency.

**No `patched()` needed:** These workflows run daily and complete in under 5 minutes. The worker does graceful shutdown on deploy (`main.ts` handles SIGTERM — stops accepting work, waits for in-flight workflows to complete). No in-flight workflow will replay with new code. Skip the `patched()` branch to avoid temporarily doubling the workflow code. If a future deploy needs it, add then.

#### Rock 3 — Typed Stage I/O Interfaces

Define explicit input types in each child workflow file (colocated, not a separate types file). `executeChild()` already infers return types from the workflow function signature — no separate output types needed until something consumes them.

```typescript
// stages/collect-sources.workflow.ts
export interface CollectSourcesInput {
  readonly epochId: string;
  readonly sources: Record<
    string,
    { attributionPipeline: string; sourceRefs: string[] }
  >;
  readonly periodStart: string;
  readonly periodEnd: string;
}

export async function CollectSourcesWorkflow(
  input: CollectSourcesInput
): Promise<void> { ... }
```

```typescript
// stages/enrich-and-allocate.workflow.ts
export interface EnrichAndAllocateInput {
  readonly epochId: string;
  readonly attributionPipeline: string;
  readonly weightConfig: Record<string, number>;
}

export async function EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow(
  input: EnrichAndAllocateInput
): Promise<void> { ... }
```

**No `stage-types.ts` barrel file.** Types live next to their workflow. If a third consumer appears, extract then. **No runtime framework** — `executeChild()` already provides type inference. Both child workflows return `void` until a consumer needs return data.

**Reuses**: Temporal SDK `executeChild()`, `patched()`, `proxyActivities()`. Existing activity functions unchanged. Existing `PipelineProfile` and registry dispatch unchanged.

**Rejected**:

- _Custom `PipelineStep<In, Out>` runtime abstraction_: Wraps `executeChild()` which already provides type safety. Adds indirection for debugging without functional benefit. Just calling functions in sequence doesn't need a framework.
- _Profile-driven stage dispatch (resolve stages from profile)_: Over-engineered. Profiles already dispatch enrichers/allocators. The workflow-level orchestration order is stable — it's the stage internals that vary via plugins.
- _New workflow function names (V2)_: Would require schedule reconfiguration. Graceful shutdown handles the migration.
- _Separate `stage-types.ts` barrel file_: Types have exactly one producer and one consumer each. Colocate with the workflow file until a third consumer appears.
- _`patched()` migration gate_: These daily workflows complete in minutes. Graceful shutdown drains in-flight work before deploying new code. Doubling the workflow code for a sub-second migration window is not worth the complexity.
- _Forced proxy config uniformity_: `scheduled-run` (1min) and `finalize-epoch` (3 retries) have intentionally different configs. Sharing only the truly duplicated ones (2min standard, 5min external API).

### Invariants

- [ ] TEMPORAL_DETERMINISM: Child workflows contain zero I/O — only `proxyActivities` calls and deterministic logic (spec: temporal-patterns-spec)
- [ ] CHILD_WORKFLOW_ID_STABILITY: Child workflow IDs derived from business key (`epochId`) for idempotency (spec: temporal-patterns-spec)
- [ ] CHILD_PARENT_CLOSE_TERMINATE: Child workflows use `parentClosePolicy: TERMINATE` — children must not outlive parent
- [ ] CHILD_NO_RETRY: No child-level retry policy — failures propagate to parent immediately
- [ ] ACTIVITY_IDEMPOTENT: No activity changes — existing idempotency guarantees preserved (spec: temporal-patterns-spec)
- [ ] PROXY_CONFIGS_DRY: Duplicated configs (2-min standard, 5-min external API) extracted to shared profiles. Workflow-specific configs stay inline with rationale comments.
- [ ] STAGE_IO_COLOCATED: Input types defined in each child workflow file, not a separate barrel
- [ ] BEHAVIOR_IDENTICAL: Refactor only — same activities called in same order with same inputs. No behavior change.

### Files

**Create:**

- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/activity-profiles.ts` — Shared `proxyActivities` config profiles (STANDARD, EXTERNAL_API)
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/stages/collect-sources.workflow.ts` — Child workflow + `CollectSourcesInput` type: source collection loop
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/stages/enrich-and-allocate.workflow.ts` — Child workflow + `EnrichAndAllocateInput` type: selection → enrichment → allocation

**Modify:**

- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/collect-epoch.workflow.ts` — Use child workflows via `executeChild()`, import shared proxy configs
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/finalize-epoch.workflow.ts` — Import STANDARD from shared proxy configs (keep `maximumAttempts: 3` inline override)
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/scheduled-run.workflow.ts` — Import GRAPH_EXECUTION from shared proxy configs (keep 1-min config inline — intentionally different)
- `services/scheduler-worker/src/workflows/ledger-workflows.ts` — Export new child workflows (required for `bundleWorkflowCode` in worker + tests)

**Spec:**

- `docs/spec/temporal-patterns.md` — Already updated with "Pipeline Stage Composition" section (committed)

**Test:**

- Existing stack test (`tests/stack/attribution/collect-epoch-pipeline.stack.test.ts`) must still pass — verify `bundleWorkflowCode` picks up child workflows via updated barrel exports in `ledger-workflows.ts`

## Plan

### Checkpoint 1 — Shared Proxy Configs

1. Create `activity-profiles.ts` with STANDARD_ACTIVITY_OPTIONS and EXTERNAL_API_ACTIVITY_OPTIONS
2. Update `collect-epoch.workflow.ts` to import shared profiles (this is where the duplication lives)
3. Update `finalize-epoch.workflow.ts` and `scheduled-run.workflow.ts` to import shared profiles where they match, keep workflow-specific configs inline with rationale comments
4. Verify: `pnpm check` passes, no behavior change

### Checkpoint 2 — Child Workflows

1. Create `stages/collect-sources.workflow.ts` with `CollectSourcesInput` type — extract collection loop from `CollectEpochWorkflow` step 5
2. Create `stages/enrich-and-allocate.workflow.ts` with `EnrichAndAllocateInput` type — extract steps 6-8
3. Update `ledger-workflows.ts` barrel to export new child workflows
4. Verify: `pnpm check` passes

### Checkpoint 3 — Wire Parent Orchestrator

1. Update `CollectEpochWorkflow` to use `executeChild()` with `parentClosePolicy: TERMINATE`
2. Remove inlined steps 5-8 (replaced by child workflow calls). No `patched()` — graceful shutdown handles deploy safety.
3. Verify: `pnpm check` passes, stack test passes (confirm `bundleWorkflowCode` picks up child workflows via barrel)

## Validation

- [ ] `pnpm check` passes (lint + type + format)
- [ ] `pnpm test` passes (unit tests)
- [ ] Stack test: `pnpm dotenv -e .env.test -- vitest run --config vitest.stack.config.mts tests/stack/attribution/collect-epoch-pipeline.stack.test.ts` passes
- [ ] `CollectSourcesWorkflow` and `EnrichAndAllocateWorkflow` appear as child workflows in Temporal UI when triggered
- [ ] Duplicated proxy configs (2-min, 5-min) use shared profiles; workflow-specific configs have rationale comments
- [ ] Child workflows use `parentClosePolicy: TERMINATE` and no child-level retry

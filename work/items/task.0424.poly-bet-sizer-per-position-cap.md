title: "Poly bet sizer — per-(tenant, market) position cap (reuse `max_usdc_per_trade` for v0)"
status: needs_triage
priority: 1
rank: 5
estimate: 2
summary: "Extend the existing `SizingPolicy` cap from `per-trade` to `per-(tenant, market) position`. Today `max_usdc_per_trade` only bounds a single fill's notional. High-frequency targets that ladder into the same market produce many sub-cap fills that compound — observed on production 2026-04-29: target 0x204f… laddered into market `9d79544c2682` 7+ times, each mirrored fill ≤$3.05, cumulative position $21.35 from a $5/trade cap. v0 reuses the same `max_usdc_per_trade` field as the position ceiling (one knob, applied to both bounds) so we don't need a new field, schema, or grant change. Splits into separate per-trade vs per-position knobs only if a real target ever needs that distinction."
outcome: "Before placing a mirror BUY, `plan-mirror` reads cumulative filled notional for `(billing_account_id, market_id)` and skips with `position_cap_reached` if `existing + intent_usdc > max_usdc_per_trade`. Skip is logged as `poly.mirror.decision outcome=skipped reason=position_cap_reached` and does NOT write a ledger row (same shape as `below_market_min`). Cumulative read is the sum of `poly_copy_trade_orders.size_usdc` where `outcome=ok` for that (tenant, market) — no on-chain query, no extra port. SELL is unaffected (closes are bounded by held shares, not the cap)."

# task.0424 — Per-position cap on the bet sizer

## Why

Production observation 2026-04-29 (after V2 cutover, candidate operator funder was $100):

| market         | mirrored fills | cumulative filled |
| -------------- | -------------: | ----------------: |
| `9d79544c2682` |              7 |        **$21.35** |
| `542da4b33d86` |              3 |             $9.00 |
| `a7a23784dbba` |              3 |             $6.75 |

Per-trade cap is $5. Every individual fill respected it. But the cap is **per-fill**, not **per-(tenant, market)**. When a target ladders into one market 7 times, we mirror 7 fills, all sub-cap, summing to >4× the per-trade ceiling on a single market. Account total exposure ballooned beyond what a $5 "max risk per copied fill" ever implied to the user.

The user's mental model of "$5 max" is the position bound, not the fill bound. Fix the policy to match the model.

## Scope

**One field, one check, one log.**

In `applySizingPolicy` (or directly in `plan-mirror.ts` BUY branch — pick whichever has cleaner deps to the orders table), before returning a sized intent:

1. Read `SUM(size_usdc)` from `poly_copy_trade_orders` where `billing_account_id = tenant`, `market_id = intent.market_id`, `outcome = 'ok'`, `revoked_at IS NULL` (or whatever the project's "this fill counts" predicate is — match what `INSERT_BEFORE_PLACE` already uses for COID lookups so the bounds are consistent).
2. If `existing + intent.size_usdc > sizing.max_usdc_per_trade` → return skip `{ reason: "position_cap_reached", existing_usdc: existing }`.
3. Otherwise unchanged.

**Reuses the existing `max_usdc_per_trade` field.** v0 uses one knob for both bounds. A real target that justifies splitting (e.g. one where a $5 trade in a $20 position is genuinely the right policy) is the trigger to add a second field.

**No new port, no new schema, no grant change, no UI.**

## Out of scope

- A separate `max_usdc_per_position` field. Add it later only if a target's behavior justifies the complexity.
- Reading on-chain pUSD position size. The DB-tracked filled total is authoritative for our bookkeeping; on-chain drift is a different bug.
- Backfilling the cap against existing positions. v0 only constrains forward.
- SELL bounds (already constrained by held shares).
- Time-windowed caps ("$5 per 24h per market"). Different shape, defer.

## Files to touch

- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/plan-mirror.ts` — add the cumulative-notional read + cap check before returning the sized intent. New `position_cap_reached` skip reason.
- `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/mirror-pipeline.ts` — extend the decision-log enum if `reason` is typed.
- `packages/poly-copy-trade-store/src/port/...` (or wherever `poly_copy_trade_orders` reads live) — add a cumulative-notional reader if not already there. One query, indexed by `(billing_account_id, market_id)`.
- Tests: extend `plan-mirror.test.ts` with fixtures for first-fill-under-cap (place), Nth-fill-tips-over-cap (skip), Nth-fill-still-under-cap (place).

## Validation

**exercise:** point a tenant at a known high-frequency target (or replay), let one market accumulate near-cap, observe the next mirror intent skip with `position_cap_reached` instead of placing.

**observability:**

```logql
{env="candidate-a", service="app"} | json
  | event="poly.mirror.decision"
  | reason="position_cap_reached"
```

Should fire once per attempted-but-capped fill, with `existing_usdc + intent_usdc > max_usdc_per_trade`.

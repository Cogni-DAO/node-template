status: needs_implement
priority: 0
rank: 1
estimate: 1
summary: "Replace HEARTBEAT → git-sync with a structured operator loop that picks the top work item, dispatches lifecycle skills via brain subagent, tracks WIP across runs, reads real LLM cost + credit + treasury data, calculates runway, verifies past decisions via external signals, and circuit-breaks after 3 failures."
outcome: "Each hourly run: sync branches, read real cost/health/treasury metrics, calculate runway with color indicator (🟢/🟡/🔴), check WIP status from last run, pick highest-priority work item (finish before starting), dispatch the appropriate lifecycle skill per development-lifecycle spec, record decision as EDO with verification criteria, and post summary with runway to Discord. The agent knows its burn rate, credit balance, treasury balance, and tracks what it started."

# Mission Control: Operator Loop with WIP Tracking and Work Item Execution

## Context

The HEARTBEAT schedule fires hourly via Temporal and routes to `/git-sync`. The agent has zero situational awareness, zero prioritization, and does no actual work. It is observe-and-forget: it cannot tell you what it was working on, whether its last action landed, how much money it has spent, or whether any of its past decisions produced results.

**What already exists but is disconnected:**

| Piece                                                           | Where                                                                             |

| Health metrics (cost, tokens, errors, services, memory, alerts) | `.openclaw/skills/deployment-health/queries.sh`                                   |
| Decision contract (focus/action/no-op with expected outcome)    | `.openclaw/skills/gov-core/SKILL.md`                                              |
| Operator checklist (Orient/Pick/Execute/Maintain/Reflect)       | `gateway-workspace/GOVERN.md`                                                     |
| EDO decision tracking with outcome checks                       | `gateway-workspace/memory/EDO/`                                                   |

| Lifecycle skills                                                | `/triage`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/closeout`, `/pull-request`, `/test`, `/bug` |
| Prioritized work item index                                     | `work/items/_index.md` (via `/repo/current/`)                                     |

**What is missing:** routing, WIP memory, financial feedback (including treasury/credit runway — see [governance-visibility-dashboard research](../../docs/research/governance-visibility-dashboard.md)), outcome verification, circuit breaker, and work item execution. This task wires all existing pieces into a single deterministic loop.

**Key research input:** The governance-visibility-dashboard research (spike for story.0063) identifies credit balance, burn rate, and runway calculation as critical data sources. The 2026-02-15 incident proved that zero credit balance halts all governance silently. This loop must surface runway data with color coding (🟢/🟡/🔴) so the agent knows when funding is running out.

## Design

### Research-Backed Principles

These findings constrain the design:

1. **Budget tracker provides continuous signal** (Google BATS) — the agent MUST see its own cost data, not guess. Without real spend data, agents waste 40% more resources.
2. **Reflection-retrieval** (BabyAGI) — store reflections after each task; retrieve past reflections for similar objectives on next run. Improves task quality measurably.
3. **Plan-and-Execute over ReAct** — separate planning (mission-control) from execution (brain subagent). ReAct exhibits goal drift after dozens of steps.
4. **Hard iteration caps** — `MAX_STEPS` is non-negotiable. Circuit breaker: 3 failures on same task means escalate or skip.
5. **External verification over self-correction** — use tests, type checks, git status, Grafana metrics. LLMs cannot self-correct reasoning without external signals.
6. **Outcome tracking, not activity tracking** — measure downstream impact (did the PR merge? did the error rate drop?), not tasks closed.
7. **Stale reasoning detection** — old reasoning becomes misleading. Use fresh context per run, not accumulated history.

### The Operator Loop (centerpiece)

A **structured procedure** with three phases: mechanical data gathering (Steps 1-5), agent judgment for work selection and dispatch (Steps 6-7), and mechanical recording/reporting (Steps 8-9). Each step has bounded output and a clear completion signal.

```
HEARTBEAT trigger arrives
  │
  ▼
/mission-control skill
  │
  ├─ Step 1. SYNC (existing git-sync, ~5s)
  │     Run /git-sync. If it fails, log and continue.
  │
  ├─ Step 2. OBSERVE (~10s, cheap curl calls only)
  │     a. Run queries.sh all → capture health snapshot
  │     b. Run mc-billing.sh all → get cost, credits, treasury, runway
  │     c. Read work/items/_index.md from /repo/current/
  │     d. Truncate each output to ≤500 chars
  │
  ├─ Step 3. CHECK WIP (~5s)
  │     Read WIP.md. For each active entry:
  │       - Check completion signal (git status, PR state, work item status)
  │       - If DONE → move to WIP.md completed section, record reflection
  │       - If STALE (started >3 runs ago, no progress) → increment fail_count
  │       - If fail_count ≥ 3 → CIRCUIT BREAK: post Discord escalation,
  │         mark item as blocked in WIP.md, move on
  │
  ├─ Step 4. CHECK PAST DECISIONS (~5s)
  │     Read edo_index.md. For each EDO with by_date ≤ now:
  │       - Query the verification_method (metric query, git status, etc.)
  │       - Record verdict: confirmed | failed | inconclusive
  │       - Write verdict back to EDO file
  │
  ├─ Step 5. UPDATE BUDGET + RUNWAY (~2s)
  │     Read _budget_header.md. Update with REAL data from mc-billing.sh:
  │       - period_spend_usd (from 24h cost)
  │       - burn_rate_usd_per_day (from 7d cost / 7)
  │       - credit_balance_usd (from cmd_credits, if available)
  │       - treasury_usdc (from cmd_treasury, if available)
  │       - runway_days = (credit_balance_usd + treasury_usdc) / burn_rate_usd_per_day
  │       - runway_indicator: 🟢 >30d, 🟡 7-30d, 🔴 <7d
  │     Budget gate (day 1): if credit balance available, use it.
  │       Otherwise, use daily spend proxy: if period_spend_usd > DAILY_BUDGET_USD → CAN_DISPATCH=false
  │       (DAILY_BUDGET_USD is configurable in mc-billing.sh, default $5.00)
  │
  ├─ Step 6. PICK WORK ITEM (exactly 1)
  │     If CAN_DISPATCH=false → skip to Step 8 with reason "over_budget"
  │     If WIP has an active non-blocked item → continue that item
  │     Otherwise: read _index.md, pick top-priority item by:
  │       active_alerts > needs_merge > needs_closeout > needs_implement > needs_design > needs_research > needs_triage
  │       (Finish before starting — items closer to done get priority, per development-lifecycle spec)
  │     Write selection to WIP.md with start_time and expected_signal
  │
  ├─ Step 7. DISPATCH (the expensive part — brain subagent)
  │     Determine lifecycle stage from work item status (per development-lifecycle spec):
  │       needs_merge     → /review-implementation  (weight: 6)
  │       needs_closeout  → /closeout               (weight: 5)
  │       needs_implement → /implement              (weight: 4)
  │       needs_design    → /design                 (weight: 3)
  │       needs_research  → /research               (weight: 2)
  │       needs_triage    → /triage                 (weight: 1)
  │       active alert    → /bug (create work item first, then triage)
  │     Delegate to brain subagent with:
  │       - work item path
  │       - lifecycle skill to run
  │       - max_tokens budget (from remaining budget)
  │       - expected completion signal
  │     Record dispatch in WIP.md
  │
  ├─ Step 8. RECORD
  │     a. Write EDO file (if action taken) with:
  │        - decision, evidence_refs, expected_outcome
  │        - verification_method (specific query or check)
  │        - by_date (next run time)
  │     b. Update edo_index.md
  │     c. Write reflection to WIP.md completed section (if any item finished)
  │
  └─ Step 9. REPORT → Discord governance channel
        One message, three lines:
          <runway_indicator> Health: <nominal|degraded|critical> | Cost: $X.XX/24h ($X.XX/7d) | Runway: Xd
          Action: <dispatched /skill on task.XXXX> | <no-op: reason>
          EDO checks: N confirmed, N failed, N inconclusive
```

### mc-billing.sh Design

Self-contained script that queries Prometheus directly (reuses `prom_query` helper pattern from queries.sh, not shelling out to it). Also queries credit balance from the app and DAO wallet USDC balance from Base mainnet RPC. Calculates runway with color coding per governance-visibility-dashboard research.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mc-billing.sh — Financial health: LLM cost, credit balance, treasury, runway
# Queries Prometheus directly (same pattern as queries.sh prom_query helper)
# Commands: cost | credits | treasury | runway | all
# Output: machine-readable key=value pairs

**Day 1 known gaps:**
- **Credit balance**: No auth-free internal endpoint exists yet. `cmd_credits` attempts `GET /api/v1/governance/health` but will return `unknown` until task.0083 (governance health endpoint) is implemented. When credits are unknown, budget gate falls back to daily spend threshold: `cost_24h_usd > DAILY_BUDGET_USD` skips dispatch.
- **Treasury balance**: `cmd_treasury` queries Base mainnet public RPC for DAO wallet USDC balance (address from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`). This should work day 1 since the RPC is public and requires no API key.
- **Runway**: When credit balance is unknown, runway is calculated from treasury only. This underestimates but is safe (conservative).

### SKILL.md Structure

The skill file at `.openclaw/skills/mission-control/SKILL.md` is a structured procedure with two phases: a **mechanical phase** (Steps 1-5: bash commands, file reads, no judgment) and a **judgment phase** (Steps 6-7: requires agent reasoning to pick and dispatch work). Step 8-9 are mechanical again.

```markdown
# /mission-control

> Autonomous operator loop. Runs on HEARTBEAT schedule (hourly).

## Phase 1: GATHER (mechanical — bash commands + file reads, no reasoning)

### Step 1: SYNC

Run /git-sync. Log result. Continue regardless of outcome.

### Step 2: OBSERVE

Run these commands and capture output (truncate each to 500 chars):

  bash /repo/current/.openclaw/skills/deployment-health/queries.sh all
  bash /repo/current/.openclaw/skills/mission-control/mc-billing.sh all
  cat /repo/current/work/items/\_index.md | head -80

### Step 3: CHECK WIP

Read /workspace/memory/mission-control/WIP.md (create if missing).
For each item in ## Active:

- Check expected_signal using external tools (gh pr list, git log, etc.)
- If signal met → move to ## Completed with reflection
- If not met → increment last_checked timestamp
- If fail_count ≥ 3 → move to ## Blocked, post Discord escalation

### Step 4: CHECK PAST DECISIONS

Read /workspace/memory/EDO/edo_index.md.
For each EDO with by_date ≤ now:

- Run the verification_method listed in the EDO
- Write verdict (confirmed/failed/inconclusive) to the EDO file

### Step 5: UPDATE BUDGET + RUNWAY

From mc-billing.sh output, update /workspace/memory/\_budget_header.md:

- period_spend_usd = cost_24h_usd
- burn_rate = burn_rate_usd_per_day
- credit_balance_usd (from cmd_credits, may be "unknown")
- treasury_usdc (from cmd_treasury)
- runway_days + runway_indicator (🟢/🟡/🔴)

Budget gate decision:
  IF credit_balance_usd is known AND credit_balance_usd ≤ 0 → CAN_DISPATCH=false
  ELSE IF credit_balance_usd is unknown AND cost_24h_usd > daily_budget_usd → CAN_DISPATCH=false
  ELSE → CAN_DISPATCH=true

## Phase 2: DECIDE (requires agent judgment)

### Step 6: PICK WORK ITEM

IF CAN_DISPATCH=false → skip to Step 8, reason="over_budget"
IF WIP ## Active has a non-blocked item → continue it (do NOT start new work)
OTHERWISE → read \_index.md, pick the highest-weight item:

  Priority ordering (finish before starting, per development-lifecycle spec):
    needs_merge     → weight 6 (nearly done, just needs review)
    needs_closeout  → weight 5
    needs_implement → weight 4
    needs_design    → weight 3
    needs_research  → weight 2
    needs_triage    → weight 1
  Within same weight: sort by priority ASC, then rank ASC.

Write selection to WIP.md ## Active with start_time and expected_signal.

### Step 7: DISPATCH

Map work item status to lifecycle skill (per development-lifecycle spec):

  needs_merge     → /review-implementation
  needs_closeout  → /closeout
  needs_implement → /implement
  needs_design    → /design
  needs_research  → /research
  needs_triage    → /triage
  active alert    → /bug (create work item first, then triage)

Delegate to brain subagent with: work item path, skill, token budget.
Update WIP.md with dispatch details.

## Phase 3: RECORD + REPORT (mechanical)

### Step 8: RECORD

If action taken → write EDO with verification_method and by_date.
Update edo_index.md.
If any item completed → ensure reflection is in WIP.md.

### Step 9: REPORT

Post to Discord governance channel (single message):
Line 1: <runway_indicator> Health: <status> | Cost: $X.XX/24h ($X.XX/7d) | Runway: Xd
Line 2: Action: <skill dispatched on item> OR no-op: <reason>
Line 3: EDO checks: N confirmed, N failed, N inconclusive

EXIT. Do not continue processing.

## Constraints

- MAX_STEPS: 9 (this procedure). No additional steps.
- Exactly 1 work item per run. No sprawl.
- Brain subagent handles all code writes. Mission-control only reads + dispatches.
  Exception: WIP.md, EDO files, \_budget_header.md are written directly.
- If any step takes >60s, skip it and note in report.
```

- `.openclaw/skills/mission-control/SKILL.md` — the operator loop procedure (deterministic checklist)
- `.openclaw/skills/mission-control/mc-billing.sh` — cost extraction + burn rate calculation
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/memory/mission-control/WIP.md` — persistent WIP tracker
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/memory-templates/mission-control.WIP.md` — bootstrap template

**Modify:**

- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/SOUL.md` — change `HEARTBEAT` routing to `/mission-control`
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/HEARTBEAT.md` — update description
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/AGENTS.md` — register mission-control skill

**Keep unchanged:**

- `.openclaw/skills/deployment-health/` — queries.sh called by mc-billing.sh and Step 2
- `.openclaw/skills/git-sync/` — called as Step 1
- `.openclaw/skills/gov-core/` — decision contract used by EDO recording
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/GOVERN.md` — checklist pattern reused
- `services/sandbox-openclaw/gateway-workspace/memory/EDO/` — used as-is for decision tracking

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] HEARTBEAT_ROUTES_TO_MISSION_CONTROL: SOUL.md routes `HEARTBEAT` to `/mission-control`
- [ ] STRUCTURED_PROCEDURE: Skill is a 3-phase procedure (gather/decide/record, 9 steps total) — mechanical steps use bash, judgment steps (6-7) use agent reasoning
- [ ] WORK_ITEM_EXECUTION: The loop picks a real work item and dispatches a lifecycle skill
- [ ] WIP_TRACKING: WIP.md persists across runs; each run checks previous work status
- [ ] FINANCIAL_FEEDBACK: \_budget_header.md updated with REAL cost data, credit balance, treasury balance, and runway from mc-billing.sh
- [ ] RUNWAY_VISIBLE: Discord report includes runway_indicator (🟢 >30d, 🟡 7-30d, 🔴 <7d) and runway_days
- [ ] OUTCOME_VERIFICATION: Past EDOs checked via external signals (metrics, git, gh CLI), not self-evaluation
- [ ] CIRCUIT_BREAKER: 3 consecutive failures on same item triggers escalation + blocked status
- [ ] GOV_CORE_CONTRACT: Decision output follows gov-core format (focus/action/no-op with expected outcome)
- [ ] EDO_ON_REAL_DECISIONS: EDO written only when action taken, not on no-op
- [ ] GIT_SYNC_PRESERVED: Git sync runs as Step 1 (not removed)
- [ ] BOUNDED_CONTEXT: Each observation step output truncated to ≤500 chars
- [ ] COST_DISCIPLINE: Observation is cheap (curl/bash). Only Step 7 (brain dispatch) is expensive. Over-budget skips dispatch.
- [ ] ONE_FOCUS: Exactly one work item per run. WIP continuity preferred over starting new work.
- [ ] REFLECTION_STORED: Completed items include a reflection for future retrieval
- [ ] DISCORD_REPORT: Summary posted to governance channel every run

### Action Taxonomy

Ordered by autonomy level:

| Action                                    | How                            | Autonomous?  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| Update WIP.md / EDOs / \_budget_header.md | Direct file write              | Yes          |
| Post to Discord                           | `message` tool                 | Yes          |
| Triage work items                         | Brain subagent + /triage       | Yes          |
| Design work items                         | Brain subagent + /design       | Yes          |
| Create/update work items                  | Brain subagent + git commit    | Yes          |
| Escalate to human                         | Discord message + mark blocked | Yes          |
| Implement code / fix bugs                 | Brain subagent + /implement    | **With EDO** |
| Create PRs                                | Brain subagent + /pull-request | **With EDO** |
| Merge PRs                                 | **No** — human review required | No           |

## Validation

- [ ] Deploy with updated SOUL.md, trigger HEARTBEAT manually via gateway diagnostic script
- [ ] Verify queries.sh output and mc-billing.sh output appear in agent reasoning
- [ ] Verify WIP.md is created on first run with correct format
- [ ] Verify second run reads WIP.md and checks status of previous dispatch
- [ ] Verify \_budget_header.md is updated with real cost numbers (not zeros or placeholders)
- [ ] Verify EDO written for action with verification_method and by_date
- [ ] Verify EDO outcome check runs on subsequent run when by_date is reached
- [ ] Verify circuit breaker: mock 3 failures on same item, confirm Discord escalation posted
- [ ] Verify Discord message has all three lines (health, action, EDO checks)
- [ ] Verify git-sync still runs as Step 1
- [ ] Verify over-budget condition skips dispatch (Step 7) and reports reason
- [ ] Run 3 consecutive heartbeats — verify WIP.md carries context and reflection is stored

status: needs_closeout
priority: 0
rank: 1
estimate: 1
summary: "Pure TS function in `@cogni/repo-spec` that takes a `RepoSpec` and a list of changed file paths and returns the owning node identity: `{ kind: 'single', nodeId } | { kind: 'operator-infra' } | { kind: 'conflict', nodes } | { kind: 'miss' }`. The load-bearing function for routing AI PR reviews to per-node `.cogni/rules/`. Inverse direction of task.0380's `extractNodePath`. Pairs with task.0381's CI gate (which uses turbo at the shell level); this function provides the same routing inside the operator's review-handler runtime where shelling to turbo is not available."
outcome: "When the AI reviewer fires on a PR webhook, `dispatch.server.ts` can call `extractOwningNode(rootSpec, changedPaths)` and route the review handler to the correct per-node `.cogni/rules/` directory deterministically — or refuse to review (returning a clear status) when the PR violates the single-node-scope policy that task.0381 enforces statically. Same routing logic, two enforcement points (CI for hard fail, reviewer for graceful skip + diagnostic comment)."

# `extractOwningNode` — Files-Changed → Owning Node Resolver

## Problem

The AI reviewer needs to answer: "given the files this PR touches, which node's `.cogni/rules/` should I evaluate against?" Today there is no function that answers this. Task.0380's `extractNodePath` is the inverse direction (`nodeId → path`); `turbo ls --affected` answers it at the shell level, but the operator's review handler runs inside Next.js / Temporal — it cannot shell out to turbo.

Without this function:

- The reviewer cannot route to per-node rules even after task.0380 lands the path resolver. `extractNodePath` is unconsumed.
- The factory parameterization (`createReviewAdapterDeps(installationId, appId, key, nodeBasePath)`) has no way to compute its `nodeBasePath` argument from runtime PR data.
- The reviewer's policy contract — "this PR violates single-node-scope, refusing to review until split" — has no implementation surface. CI (task.0381) catches the violation; the reviewer must too, because reviewer status drives the merge UX.

This is the single largest missing piece in the per-node review pipeline. Building it small + locked + paired with `extractNodePath` is the gate-ladder discipline.

## Design

### Outcome

`@cogni/repo-spec` exports `extractOwningNode(spec, paths): OwningNode` where `OwningNode` is a discriminated union over the four meaningful outcomes:

```ts
type OwningNode =
  | { kind: "single"; nodeId: string; path: string }
  | { kind: "operator-infra" }
  | { kind: "conflict"; nodes: ReadonlyArray<{ nodeId: string; path: string }> }
  | { kind: "miss" };
```

The reviewer dispatches on `kind`:

- `single` → load `nodes/<path>/.cogni/rules/` and review.
- `operator-infra` → load root `.cogni/rules/` and review (operator owns infra-policy rules).
- `conflict` → post a "PR violates single-node-scope, split before review" comment; do not invoke gates.
- `miss` → post "PR touches no recognized scope" diagnostic; neutral check run.

### Approach

**Solution**: One new exported function in `packages/repo-spec/src/accessors.ts`, sibling to `extractNodes` and `extractNodePath`. Pure: no I/O, no env, no globals. Algorithm:

```
1. For each path in `paths`:
   a. Find the longest matching prefix among `spec.nodes[].path` (registry).
   b. Classify: which registry entry owns this path, or "infra" if no node prefix matches.
2. Aggregate the per-path classifications:
   - All paths classified as one node → { kind: "single", nodeId, path }
   - All paths classified as infra → { kind: "operator-infra" }
   - Mix of nodes (or one node + infra mix is allowed if the operator is in the registry) → { kind: "conflict", nodes }
   - All paths fail to classify (path under nodes/ but no registry match) → { kind: "miss" }
```

**Operator-infra recognition** — must agree byte-for-byte with task.0381's CI rule. A path is **infra** iff EITHER:

1. Its top-level dir is not `nodes/` (e.g. `packages/**`, `infra/**`, `.github/**`, `docs/**`, `work/**`, `services/**`, `scripts/**`, root configs), OR
2. Its top-level-under-`nodes/` segment is `operator` (i.e. `nodes/operator/**`).

In other words: only directories directly under `nodes/` _other than_ `operator` are sovereign. Operator is structurally exempt — not because of its registry entry, but because it IS the control plane. This mirrors task.0381's `OPERATOR_IS_INFRA` invariant exactly; without this, the two layers will disagree on `nodes/operator + nodes/poly` PRs (CI passes, reviewer refuses).

**Mixed infra + single-node**: a PR touching `packages/repo-spec/src/foo.ts` AND `nodes/poly/app/bar.ts` returns `{ kind: "single", nodeId: poly }` — the single sovereign node owns the review, with infra changes riding along. Same applies for `nodes/operator/foo + nodes/poly/bar` → `{ kind: "single", nodeId: poly }`.

### Path matching — flat top-level under `nodes/`

The match key is `path.split("/")[1]` when `path.split("/")[0] === "nodes"`. Compare against `entry.path.split("/")[1]` for each registry entry. No longest-prefix-wins, no nesting — the registry is flat by convention (`nodes/operator`, `nodes/poly`, `nodes/resy`, `nodes/node-template`) and the schema can be tightened to enforce it. If/when nesting is introduced, add LPW _then_ — not speculatively now. Matches task.0381's algorithm exactly.

`node-template` is sovereign by this rule (it's under `nodes/`, name is not `operator`). This is the desired behavior: template edits should not ride alongside poly edits.

### Reuses

- Existing `RepoSpec` type + `nodeRegistryEntrySchema` (`packages/repo-spec/src/schema.ts:259-272`)
- Existing `extractNodes(spec)` accessor (returns the array we iterate)
- task.0380's `extractNodePath` is the _return-side_ sibling — both consume the same registry data; composition only makes sense when narrowed (`if (r.kind === "single") extractNodePath(spec, r.nodeId)`).
- Native `Array.prototype.find` / `String.prototype.split` — no library, no regex.

### Rejected

- _Returning `string | null` like `extractNodePath` does_ — collapses three meaningful outcomes (single/conflict/miss/infra) into one. Caller would need a sentinel value or out-of-band signal for conflict. Discriminated union is the honest type.
- _Throwing on conflict_ — exceptions for control flow are wrong here; "conflict" is a _result_, not an error condition. Reviewer wants to dispatch on it, not catch it.
- _Treating operator as a sovereign node when its registry entry exists_ — earlier draft did this and conflicted with task.0381's `OPERATOR_IS_INFRA` invariant. Now: `nodes/operator/**` is structurally infra (top-level-segment check), independent of registry contents. Single canonical rule, no caller-side resolution needed.
- _Longest-prefix-wins for nested registry paths_ — premature; current registry is flat by convention. Add LPW the day a nested entry appears, not before.
- _Putting it in `nodes/operator/app/src/features/review/`_ — couples to one consumer. Future scope router, scheduler routing, attribution may all want this.
- _Bundling it with task.0381's CI gate_ — wrong altitude. Bash + turbo at CI time vs. TS + RepoSpec inside operator runtime. Both implement the same policy from different layers; both belong but separately.
- _Bundling it with the reviewer factory parameterization_ — defeats the gate-ladder. Function locked alone first, consumer rides on top.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] **PURE_RESOLVER**: `extractOwningNode` performs no I/O, no env reads, no logging. `(RepoSpec, readonly string[]) → OwningNode` and nothing else.
- [ ] **DISCRIMINATED_UNION**: Return type is the four-case discriminated union. No sentinel strings, no null-as-conflict. Locked by type-level test.
- [ ] **LONGEST_PREFIX_WINS**: When registry has nested paths, the longest matching prefix owns the file. Locked by a scenario fixture.
- [ ] **INFRA_RIDE_ALONG**: A mix of infra paths + a single sovereign node returns `{ kind: "single", nodeId }` — infra rides along, does not trigger conflict. Matches task.0381 exemption logic.
- [ ] **EMPTY_INPUT**: `extractOwningNode(spec, [])` returns `{ kind: "miss" }`. (Was `operator-infra` — changed to `miss` so an empty diff produces a "no changes to review" neutral check at the dispatcher rather than an accidental root-rules invocation.)
- [ ] **OPERATOR_IS_INFRA**: Paths whose top-level-under-`nodes/` is `operator` are classified as infra, NOT as a sovereign node, regardless of whether the operator has a registry entry. Locked by parity with task.0381.
- [ ] **CONFLICT_ORDERING**: `conflict.nodes` is sorted by `nodeId` (string compare) — deterministic so reviewer diagnostic comments don't flap.
- [ ] **NO_CROSS_VALIDATION**: This function does not validate path safety (no `..`, no absolute paths). Caller responsibility, same as `extractNodePath`. Documented in TSDoc.
- [ ] **CANONICAL_POLICY_HOME**: This function is the single source of truth for "which node owns these paths" across the workspace. Task.0381's bash gate consumes it via a thin CLI wrapper shipped from `@cogni/repo-spec` (deferred to a follow-on; tracked in the parity-test task), not by re-implementing the rule in shell.

### Files

- Modify: `packages/repo-spec/src/accessors.ts` — add `extractOwningNode` function + `OwningNode` type (~40 lines body + TSDoc).
- Modify: `packages/repo-spec/src/index.ts` — export both.
- Modify: `tests/unit/packages/repo-spec/accessors.test.ts` — add `describe("extractOwningNode", …)` block (~10 scenarios, ~150 lines, consuming `@cogni/repo-spec/testing` fixtures from task.0380).
- Modify: `packages/repo-spec/AGENTS.md` — document new export.

### Test scenarios

1. **Single sovereign node** — paths all under `nodes/poly/...` → `{ kind: "single", nodeId: poly, path: "nodes/poly" }`.
2. **All infra (non-`nodes/`)** — paths all under `packages/`, `infra/`, `docs/` → `{ kind: "operator-infra" }`.
3. **All infra (operator)** — paths all under `nodes/operator/...` → `{ kind: "operator-infra" }` (operator is structurally infra, regardless of registry).
4. **Mixed sovereign node + non-`nodes/` infra** — `nodes/poly/foo.ts` + `packages/repo-spec/bar.ts` → `{ kind: "single", nodeId: poly }`.
5. **Mixed sovereign node + operator** — `nodes/poly/foo.ts` + `nodes/operator/app/bar.ts` → `{ kind: "single", nodeId: poly }` (operator rides along; matches task.0381 exemption).
6. **Conflict — two sovereign nodes** — `nodes/poly/foo.ts` + `nodes/resy/bar.ts` → `{ kind: "conflict", nodes: [poly, resy] }` (sorted by nodeId).
7. **Conflict — three sovereign nodes** → all three named in the conflict result, sorted by nodeId.
8. **Miss** — path under `nodes/unregistered-node/foo.ts` (top-level segment is not `operator` and no registry entry matches) → `{ kind: "miss" }`.
9. **Empty input** — `[]` → `{ kind: "miss" }`.
10. **node-template is sovereign** — paths under `nodes/node-template/...` resolve as a sovereign node (or `miss` if not registered), NOT as infra. Confirms node-template participates in single-node-scope policy.

### Pairing with task.0381

These two tasks implement the **same policy at two layers**:

- **task.0381** (CI / pre-merge): bash + turbo at GitHub Actions level. Hard fail. Cheap, fast, runs without operator. Required status check.
- **task.0382** (reviewer / runtime): TS + RepoSpec inside operator. Soft fail with diagnostic comment. Runs where the AI reviewer lives.

Both must agree. If they disagree, that's a real bug — captured by a contract test that exercises a fixed PR diff against both implementations. **Defer the contract test to a follow-on**; ship 0381 + 0382 first, then the parity test once both exist.

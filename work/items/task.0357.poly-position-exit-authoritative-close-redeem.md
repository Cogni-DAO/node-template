summary: "Fix the user exit path so Polymarket close/redeem flows are driven by authoritative provider and chain state instead of stale DB/Data-API hints. Revalidate trading approvals live on exit, refresh Polymarket's own balance/allowance cache before market SELL, stop treating one immediate `/positions` reread as truth, and return typed exit outcomes that distinguish provider rejection, accepted/pending reconciliation, flat exit, and irreducible liquidity/min-size cases."
outcome: "A user can click Close or Redeem and the system either exits/redeems the position or returns a typed provider-grounded reason. Internal grant caps, stale `tradingApprovalsReadyAt` stamps, and one-shot lagging `/positions` reads never strand user funds."

# task.0357 — Poly position exits

## Requirements

- User-driven `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/close` must never be blocked by grant caps (`perOrderUsdcCap`, daily cap, hourly fills cap).
- Exit readiness must be validated against the live pinned approval target set before a close attempt; the DB readiness stamp is a cache/UI hint, not authoritative truth.
- After live approvals are good on-chain, the close path must refresh Polymarket's own `/balance-allowance` view before market SELL. Candidate-a proved the provider can still reject with `allowance: 0` while our direct chain reads say the spender is approved.
- A successful or accepted Polymarket market-sell response must never be turned into a 502 solely because one immediate public Data API `/positions` reread still shows the old balance.
- After a successful close or redeem, the dashboard's next refetch must not reuse a stale wallet-analysis execution snapshot from the process TTL cache.
- Exit execution must use types that match the provider's execution units. Share-based market exits must not be forced through a USDC-notional `OrderReceipt` abstraction without explicit normalization.
- Redeem must remain uncapped and move toward chain-authoritative eligibility; the system should not strand redeemable funds behind our own policy gates or a lagging advisory read model.

## Design

### Outcome

Users can systematically exit or redeem their own positions without our code fabricating failures from stale readiness stamps or lagging read models.

### Approach

**Solution**: Treat Polygon, the Polymarket write path, and Polymarket's own balance/allowance cache as the write-path authorities, and treat the public Data API plus DB stamps as lagging read models.

**Reuses**:

- `PrivyPolyTraderWalletAdapter.ensureTradingApprovals(...)` for the pinned 5-step approval ceremony
- `PolymarketClobAdapter.sellPositionAtMarket(...)` as the market-sell primitive
- `MarketProviderPort.getOrder(...)` and existing CLOB logging/metrics surface
- Existing route/auth/container wiring for tenant-scoped wallet actions
- Existing `polymarket.ctf.redeem.ts` / `redeemPositions` flow for on-chain redemption

**Rejected**:

- Keep the current route contract and just sleep before rereading `/positions`.
  This is still a stale-read heuristic, not a correctness boundary.
- Retry every failed market exit automatically.
  Unsafe: auth/validation failures are not retry-eligible and can duplicate side effects.
- Continue using `tradingApprovalsReadyAt` as the exit gate.
  Candidate-a proved that a stamped row can coexist with live allowance drift.
- Treat the public Data API as authoritative write acknowledgement.
  It is a read model and can lag a just-accepted/just-filled order.

### Integration Shape

This is a **Port/Adapter** problem under the `third-party-integrator` decision matrix:

- production dependency
- core money movement depends on it
- CI must run without the real service
- provider quirks must be normalized behind a stable boundary

The clean boundary is:

1. `packages/market-provider`
   Add explicit exit-domain types for share-based market exits and typed provider failure taxonomy.
2. `nodes/poly/app` executor
   Orchestrate approval readiness, exit retries/backoff, and route-level response mapping.
3. HTTP contract
   Return typed exit states instead of collapsing provider acceptance + stale reconciliation into `close_failed`.

### Close Semantics

1. Discover the candidate position by `token_id` using the existing Data API position list.
2. Run live approval readiness before placing the exit.
   Preferred implementation: call `ensureTradingApprovals(billingAccountId)` on every user close.
   Reason: it already reads the pinned live target matrix first, is idempotent, and self-heals drift.
3. Refresh Polymarket's `/balance-allowance` cache for both collateral and the conditional token being exited.
   Reason: candidate-a showed that the provider can keep returning `allowance: 0` for the neg-risk adapter even after on-chain approvals are repaired.
4. Submit a market `FAK` SELL for the full share balance.
5. Normalize the provider response into a dedicated exit result, e.g.:
   - `state: "exited"` — provider accepted, reconciliation confirms no remaining position
   - `state: "submitted"` — provider accepted/fill observed, but read model is still reconciling
   - `state: "partial"` — provider made progress but a bounded retry window ended with remaining shares
   - `state: "rejected"` — provider rejected with typed reason (`AUTH_FAILED`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, `PROVIDER_ERROR`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `INSUFFICIENT_ALLOWANCE`, `NO_BID_LIQUIDITY`, etc.)

6. Reconciliation after placement must be bounded and provider-aware:
   - short backoff polling is allowed to collapse the common case to `exited`
   - a single stale `/positions` read must not fail the request
   - if the write succeeded but read reconciliation is lagging, return a non-error typed state (`submitted`), not `502`

7. A successful close/redeem must evict wallet-scoped execution/read-model caches.
   Reason: candidate-a proved the write can succeed while a warm 30 s process cache still renders the old "open" row.

### Redeem Semantics

- Redeem remains separate from close.
- Grant caps never apply to redeem.
- Immediate implementation can keep the current route shape, but the design target is chain-authoritative eligibility:
  the on-chain redeem path should be the source of truth, while Data API `redeemable` is advisory/discovery only.

### Invariants

- [ ] USER_EXITS_IGNORE_GRANT_CAPS: user close/redeem paths never apply per-order, daily, or hourly grant caps
- [ ] EXIT_READINESS_IS_LIVE: exit readiness is checked against the live pinned approval target set; `tradingApprovalsReadyAt` is never treated as sole truth for exits
- [ ] PROVIDER_BALANCE_ALLOWANCE_CACHE_IS_REAL: on-chain approvals do not by themselves prove Polymarket's live SELL path is ready; exit must refresh `/balance-allowance` before treating allowance errors as final
- [ ] PROVIDER_WRITE_ACK_BEATS_LAGGING_READ_MODEL: one stale `/positions` reread cannot negate an accepted or filled provider write
- [ ] POST_EXIT_REFETCH_SEES_FRESH_STATE: successful close/redeem paths evict wallet-scoped execution/read-model caches so the next dashboard refetch does not reuse stale holdings
- [ ] EXIT_TYPES_MATCH_EXECUTION_UNITS: share-based market exits use explicit share-grounded result types rather than overloading USDC-notional receipts
- [ ] RETRY_ONLY_SAFE_PROVIDER_ERRORS: only network/provider-transient failures are retry-eligible; auth and validation failures are surfaced directly
- [ ] REDEEM_AUTHORITY_IS_CHAIN: redeem correctness is grounded in chain state, not only in Data API advisory flags
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: reuse existing approval, CLOB, and route wiring rather than adding new background infrastructure
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT: provider normalization lives at the adapter/port boundary, orchestration in the executor, contracts in `packages/node-contracts`

### Files

- Create: `docs/spec/poly-position-exit.md` — proposed integration contract for close/redeem semantics
- Modify: `packages/node-contracts/src/poly.wallet.position-actions.v1.contract.ts` — typed close/redeem response states
- Modify: `packages/market-provider/src/domain/order.ts` or adjacent exit-domain file — explicit exit result/failure types
- Modify: `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/polymarket.clob.adapter.ts` — normalize market-exit results and typed failures
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/adapters/server/wallet/privy-poly-trader-wallet.adapter.ts` — reusable live approval/readiness helper semantics
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts` — approval revalidation, reconciliation loop, typed exit mapping
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/app/api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/close/route.ts` — return typed close states instead of generic `502`
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/app/api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/redeem/route.ts` — keep redeem uncapped and align with proposed typed semantics
- Test: `nodes/poly/app/tests/unit/bootstrap/poly-trade-executor.test.ts` — allowance drift, stale Data API, partial exit, accepted-but-pending reconcile
- Test: `packages/market-provider/tests/polymarket-clob-adapter.test.ts` — typed market-exit normalization, provider balance/allowance refresh, and retry eligibility

## Plan

- [ ] Add the proposed exit spec and lock the invariants
- [ ] Evict wallet-analysis cache entries after successful close/redeem so the dashboard reflects the new holding state immediately
- [ ] Introduce a dedicated market-exit result type at the provider boundary
- [ ] Rework executor close flow to run live approval readiness and bounded reconciliation
- [ ] Update close/redeem HTTP contracts and route responses to typed states
- [ ] Add tests for allowance drift, provider cache drift, stale `/positions`, partial fills, and redeem uncapped behavior

## Validation

- **exercise:** on `candidate-a`, with a tenant wallet that has two live positions and at least one resolved redeemable position:
  1. call `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/close` on a neg-risk token where allowance drift would previously fail; expect either `state=exited` or `state=submitted`, never `502 close_failed`, and observe the system auto-check approvals plus refresh Polymarket's balance/allowance cache before exit.
  2. call `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/close` on a non-neg-risk token that previously produced `sellPositionAtMarket: ok` followed by `market exit made no progress`; expect a typed success/pending/partial outcome, never that stale-read 502.
  3. call `POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/positions/redeem` on a resolved winning condition; expect a tx hash and no grant-cap denial.
- **observability:** Loki on the deployed SHA shows `poly.wallet.enable_trading.*`, `poly.clob.balance_allowance.sync`, `poly.exit.place.*`, and `poly.exit.reconcile.*` events for the request; there are no `poly.wallet.positions.close.error` rows whose message contains `market exit made no progress`, and no exit-denial rows caused by grant caps.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] **Work Item:** `task.0357` linked in PR body
- [ ] **Spec:** `poly-trader-wallet-port`, `architecture-spec`, and `poly-position-exit` invariants upheld

## Attribution

- Candidate-a Loki review on 2026-04-23 established the three failure classes this task fixes:
  stale approval readiness vs live allowance drift, provider cache drift (`/balance-allowance` stale while chain approvals are good), and provider success negated by lagging `/positions` rereads.

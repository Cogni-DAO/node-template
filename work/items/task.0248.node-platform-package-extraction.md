title: "Extract shared node platform into packages/node-platform"
status: needs_design
priority: 2
rank: 5
estimate: 5
summary: "Refactor the shared platform code (ports, core, shared, contracts, components, bootstrap patterns) out of apps/operator into a packages/node-platform package. All nodes and operator import from it instead of duplicating ~700 files."
outcome: "nodes/node-template/app is a thin shell (~50 files) that imports @cogni/node-platform for all shared platform functionality. Adding a new node means creating a thin app + graphs, not copying 800 files."

## Context

After task.0244-0246, each node is a full copy of the operator app (~800 files).
This works for v0 but creates drift risk — platform fixes must be applied to
every node independently.

## Goal

Extract the shared AI app platform into `packages/node-platform` so nodes are
thin shells that import shared infrastructure:

- **ports/** — all 28 port interfaces
- **core/** — domain models (accounts, ai, billing, chat, payments)
- **shared/** — env, observability, auth, config, db, crypto, web3
- **contracts/** — Zod route contracts (ai._, payments._, schedules._, users._)
- **components/** — full UI kit (shadcn, kit/\*, chat)
- **bootstrap/** — DI container pattern, capability factories, http wrappers
- **features/** — platform features (ai, payments, accounts)
- **adapters/** — platform adapters (ai, db, payments, temporal, etc.)

## What stays in each node's app

- `src/app/` — node-specific pages and routes (homepage, custom pages)
- `src/features/` — node-specific features (e.g. reservations for resy)
- `src/bootstrap/container.ts` — node-specific capability wiring
- `graphs/` — node-specific AI graphs

## Non-goals

- Runtime plugin system (nodes are still separate Next.js apps)
- Shared database migrations (each node manages own schema)

## Validation

- [ ] `packages/node-platform` builds independently
- [ ] `nodes/node-template/app` imports from `@cogni/node-platform`
- [ ] `apps/operator` imports from `@cogni/node-platform`
- [ ] All nodes + operator pass `pnpm check`
- [ ] No duplicate platform code across nodes

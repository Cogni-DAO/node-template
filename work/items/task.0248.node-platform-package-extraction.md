title: "Extract shared node platform into packages/node-platform"
status: needs_design
priority: 1
rank: 5
estimate: 5
summary: "Refactor the shared platform code (ports, core, shared, contracts, components, bootstrap patterns) out of apps/operator into a packages/node-platform package. All nodes and operator import from it instead of duplicating ~700 files."
outcome: "nodes/node-template/app is a thin shell (~50 files) that imports @cogni/node-platform for all shared platform functionality. Adding a new node means creating a thin app + graphs, not copying 800 files."

## Context

After task.0244-0246, each node is a full copy of the operator app (~800 files).
This works for v0 but creates drift risk — platform fixes must be applied to
every node independently.

## Goal

Extract the shared AI app platform into `packages/node-platform` so nodes are
thin shells that import shared infrastructure:

- **ports/** — all 28 port interfaces
- **core/** — domain models (accounts, ai, billing, chat, payments)
- **shared/** — env, observability, auth, config, db, crypto, web3
- **contracts/** — Zod route contracts (ai._, payments._, schedules._, users._)
- **components/** — full UI kit (shadcn, kit/\*, chat)
- **bootstrap/** — DI container pattern, capability factories, http wrappers
- **features/** — platform features (ai, payments, accounts)
- **adapters/** — platform adapters (ai, db, payments, temporal, etc.)

## What stays in each node's app

- `src/app/` — node-specific pages and routes (homepage, custom pages)
- `src/features/` — node-specific features (e.g. reservations for resy)
- `src/bootstrap/container.ts` — node-specific capability wiring
- `graphs/` — node-specific AI graphs

## Shared UI standardization (part of extraction)

When extracting the platform package, also standardize these UI patterns
across all nodes so new nodes get them for free:

- Clean GitHub icon link in header (poly's pattern — no stars counter widget)
- Sign-in button/link in landing page header — keep the current teal-outlined style (poly's Header.tsx pattern is clean). Fix auth flow per bug.0255
- Per-node color theming via CSS variables only (operator=blue, poly=teal, resy=blue)

Related: bug.0255 (node landing page auth flow broken — useTryDemo not wired)

## Auth extraction (per multi-node-tenancy spec)

The auth model must move from "4 identical auth.ts files" to "operator is IdP,
nodes are SSO relying parties" (SHARED_IDENTITY_ISOLATED_SESSIONS):

- Extract shared auth config (providers, callbacks, user_bindings logic) into
  `packages/node-platform` or a dedicated `packages/auth-core`
- Each node mints its own origin-scoped session after IdP verification
  (SSO_THEN_LOCAL_SESSION) — no parent-domain cookies (ORIGIN_SCOPED_COOKIES)
- Operator owns the identity provider; nodes configure SSO against it
- Per-node AUTH_SECRET (not shared) in production

## Per-node database (per multi-node-tenancy spec)

Per DB_PER_NODE: each node gets its own database on a shared Postgres server.
This task must ensure the extracted platform supports per-node DATABASE_URL:

- `packages/node-platform` DB client accepts connection config at construction
  (PACKAGES_NO_ENV — credentials injected, not read from env)
- Migration tooling runs per-node (each node manages its own schema version)
- RLS policies remain within each node's DB (user/account-scoped)
- No tenancy columns (node_id) in node-local tables (DB_IS_BOUNDARY)

## Urgency: dev memory pressure

Each Next.js node dev server (Turbopack) uses ~3 GB RAM for the 840-file app.
Running operator + poly + resy = ~9 GB just for dev servers, before Docker infra.
This makes local multi-node development impractical on most machines.

Extracting the shared platform means each node compiles only its ~50 thin-shell
files + the pre-built package — dramatically reducing per-node Turbopack memory.
Combined with task.0181 (move AI runtime to scheduler-worker), node apps shed
AI deps entirely, further shrinking the compilation footprint.

## Non-goals

- Runtime plugin system (nodes are still separate Next.js apps)
- Operator aggregation plane (separate concern, V2 per migration path)
- Federation auth protocol (V3 concern)

## Validation

- [ ] `packages/node-platform` builds independently
- [ ] `nodes/node-template/app` imports from `@cogni/node-platform`
- [ ] `apps/operator` imports from `@cogni/node-platform`
- [ ] All nodes + operator pass `pnpm check`
- [ ] No duplicate platform code across nodes

# Deduplicate node platform: targeted package extractions + bounded node workspaces

## Context

After task.0244-0246, each node is a full copy of the operator app (~675 files). Only ~15 files per node actually differ (layout, container, tool-bindings, server-env, tailwind, MCP config). The remaining ~660 files are byte-for-byte identical copies that drift independently.

## Design

### Outcome

Node-template is the golden path. Adding a new node = scaffold from template, customize ~15 files, add graphs. Platform fixes land in shared packages, all nodes get them via `workspace:*` deps.

### Approach

**Solution:** Three-layer extraction, following the established capability-package pattern. Each layer is an independent PR that can be reviewed and validated separately.

**Rejected alternatives:**
1. **One `@cogni/node-platform` monolith package** — Violates PURE_LIBRARY (features use Next.js, components use React, bootstrap reads env). Mixes 5 architectural layers in one package. Creates a god-dependency.
2. **Turborepo/Next.js shared app overlay** — No established pattern in codebase. Turbopack's transpilePackages doesn't solve the identical-file problem. Novel infra for unclear benefit.
3. **Symlinks** — Fragile, confusing for IDEs, breaks git history, not a pnpm workspace pattern.

### Architecture: What goes where

Based on framework-coupling analysis of the actual code:

| Layer | Files | Framework deps | Extractable? | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ports/** | 32 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-ports` |
| **core/** | 24 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-core` |
| **contracts/** | 55 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-contracts` |
| **types/** | 7 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-core` |
| **shared/** (pure) | 81 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-shared` |
| **shared/hooks/** | 1 | React | No | stays in app |
| **adapters/** | 159 | 0 | Yes | `@cogni/node-adapters` |
| **features/** | 153 | 70 Next.js | **No** | stays in app (Next.js coupled) |
| **components/** | 101 | 96 React | **No** | stays in app (React coupled) |
| **bootstrap/** | 36 | 18 env/process | **No** | stays in app (runtime wiring) |
| **app/** (routes) | 157 | Next.js | **No** | stays in app |

**Extractable:** ~358 files (ports + core + contracts + types + shared-pure + adapters)
**Stays in app:** ~448 files (features + components + bootstrap + app routes + hooks)

But since features/components/bootstrap are 99% identical across nodes, we solve that duplication differently: **node apps import shared features/components from node-template via workspace reference**, not via package extraction.

### Node workspace structure (aligned with bounded-product pattern)

```
nodes/
  node-template/          # Golden path — source of truth for platform code
    .cogni/               # repo-spec, node metadata
    apps/
      web/                # The Next.js app (renamed from app/)
        src/
          app/            # Next.js routes (template defaults)
          features/       # Platform features (shared via workspace ref)
          components/     # Platform UI (shared via workspace ref)
          bootstrap/      # DI container (template default, nodes override)
          shared/hooks/   # React hooks (framework-coupled)
          styles/         # Tailwind, theme
    packages/
      graphs/             # Node-specific graphs (renamed from graphs/)
    infra/                # Future: node-specific compose overlays

  poly/
    .cogni/
    apps/
      web/                # Thin shell: layout overrides, poly-specific pages
        src/
          app/            # Poly routes + pages (homepage, custom)
          features/       # Poly-specific features only
          components/     # Poly-specific components only (Header, Hero, etc.)
          bootstrap/      # Poly container.ts + tool-bindings.ts overrides
          styles/         # Poly theme (tailwind.css override)
    packages/
      graphs/             # Poly-specific graphs (poly-brain, etc.)
```

**Key principle:** `node-template/apps/web` is a **complete, runnable app**. Poly's `apps/web` overrides only what differs (~15 files), importing the rest from shared packages.

### Package extraction plan (ordered by value / risk)

**Phase 1 — Pure domain extractions (zero risk, immediate dedup)**

| Package | From | Files | Deps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@cogni/node-contracts` | `src/contracts/` | 55 | `zod`, `@cogni/ai-core` |
| `@cogni/node-core` | `src/core/` + `src/types/` | 31 | None (pure domain) |

These are already 100% identical across all nodes, have zero framework deps, and follow the exact capability-package pattern.

**Phase 2 — Port + adapter extractions (subsumes task.0250)**

| Package | From | Files | Deps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@cogni/node-ports` | `src/ports/` | 32 | `@cogni/ai-core`, `@cogni/graph-execution-core` |
| `@cogni/graph-execution-host` | `src/adapters/server/ai/` subset | ~20 | `@cogni/ai-core`, `@cogni/langgraph-graphs`, `@cogni/ai-tools` |
| `@cogni/node-adapters` | `src/adapters/` (remainder) | ~139 | `@cogni/node-ports`, various |

`@cogni/node-ports` must extract first (adapters depend on ports). `@cogni/graph-execution-host` extracts the AI execution subset (task.0250 design, reviewed and approved) as part of this phase. Remaining adapters become `@cogni/node-adapters`.

**Phase 3 — Shared utilities**

| Package | From | Files | Deps |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@cogni/node-shared` | `src/shared/` minus hooks | 81 | `pino`, `node:crypto` |

This includes observability, config helpers, content-scrubbing, crypto utils — all pure functions with zero framework deps.

**Phase 4 — Framework-coupled dedup (different strategy)**

Features, components, bootstrap are React/Next.js-coupled and CANNOT be pure packages per `packages-architecture.md:58`. For these, use **workspace inheritance**:

- Node-template `apps/web/` is the canonical complete app
- Other nodes' `apps/web/` are thin shells that:
  - Override only differing files (container.ts, tool-bindings, layout components, server-env, tailwind)
  - Import shared features/components from `@cogni/node-platform-ui` (a React package, not a PURE_LIBRARY — uses `"react"` as peerDependency, similar to how shadcn/ui works)
  - OR: use Next.js `transpilePackages` to reference node-template's source directly

Phase 4 is the most complex and should be designed separately after Phases 1-3 prove the pattern.

### Relationship to task.0250/0251/0252

task.0250 (extract graph-execution-host) is **absorbed into Phase 2** of this task. The design decisions from task.0250's review still apply:
- Type ownership: define in package, app re-exports (same PR)
- Constructor injection for Logger (PURE_LIBRARY compliant)
- Opaque CompletionStreamFn signature
- Inline EVENT_NAMES strings

task.0251 (wire execution in scheduler-worker) and task.0252 (strip AI deps from Next.js) remain independent — they consume the extracted package.

### Invariants

- [ ] PURE_LIBRARY: All extracted packages have no process lifecycle, no env vars, no framework deps (spec: packages-architecture)
- [ ] NO_SRC_IMPORTS: Packages never import `@/` or `src/` paths (spec: packages-architecture)
- [ ] COMPOSITE_BUILD: All packages use TypeScript composite mode (spec: packages-architecture)
- [ ] DB_PER_NODE: Extracted adapters accept DB client via constructor, not env (spec: multi-node-tenancy)
- [ ] NO_CROSS_IMPORTS: No imports between `nodes/poly/**` and `nodes/resy/**` (spec: multi-node-tenancy)
- [ ] CAPABILITY_PER_PACKAGE: One package per capability, not one monolith (spec: packages-architecture)

## Plan

### Phase 1: Extract `@cogni/node-contracts` + `@cogni/node-core`

- [ ] Create `packages/node-contracts/` with all Zod route contracts
- [ ] Create `packages/node-core/` with domain models + types
- [ ] Rewire all 4 apps (operator + 3 nodes) to import from packages
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

### Phase 2: Extract ports + adapters (includes task.0250 scope)

- [ ] Create `@cogni/node-ports` with all 32 port interfaces
- [ ] Create `@cogni/graph-execution-host` (task.0250 design)
- [ ] Create `@cogni/node-adapters` with remaining adapters
- [ ] Rewire all apps
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

### Phase 3: Extract `@cogni/node-shared`

- [ ] Create `packages/node-shared/` with pure shared utilities
- [ ] Move `shared/hooks/useIsMobile.ts` to app-local (1 React file)
- [ ] Rewire all apps
- [ ] `pnpm check` passes

### Phase 4: Node workspace restructure

- [ ] Rename `nodes/*/app/` → `nodes/*/apps/web/`
- [ ] Rename `nodes/*/graphs/` → `nodes/*/packages/graphs/`
- [ ] Update `pnpm-workspace.yaml` globs
- [ ] Design framework-coupled sharing strategy (separate design task)

## Validation

Each phase independently:
```bash
pnpm check
```

After all phases:
```bash
# Verify no duplicate platform code
diff -rq packages/node-ports/src/ apps/operator/src/ports/ 2>/dev/null
# Should show: apps/operator/src/ports/ re-exports from @cogni/node-ports

# Verify nodes are thin
find nodes/poly/apps/web/src -type f | wc -l
# Target: <100 (down from 675)
```

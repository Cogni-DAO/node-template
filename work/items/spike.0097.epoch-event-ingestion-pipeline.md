# Research: Epoch Event Ingestion Pipeline

## Context

The existing specs are slightly misguided in opposite directions:

- **ai-governance-data.md**: Over-engineered CloudEvents → brief → agent pipeline with too many bespoke types
- **epoch-ledger.md**: Manual-only receipt issuance — no automated event ingestion

This spike surveys SourceCred's plugin architecture and OSS tooling to design a unified ingestion pipeline that feeds the epoch ledger with minimal bespoke code.

## Requirements

### Research questions

1. What SourceCred plugin/graph/ledger patterns can we adopt (design, not code)?
2. What OSS libraries handle GitHub/Discord event normalization?
3. How do we bridge automated event ingestion → the existing epoch ledger schema?
4. What's the minimal bespoke code needed?

## Allowed Changes

- New research doc in `docs/research/`
- New spike work item
- No code changes

## Plan

- [x] Deep-read SourceCred plugin architecture, graph model, ledger, credequate system
- [x] Survey OSS: CloudEvents SDK, Octokit, discord.js, Coordinape patterns, event sourcing libs
- [x] Audit existing cogni-template: billing, ledger schema, Temporal worker, governance ports
- [x] Write research doc with findings, recommendations, and proposed layout

## Validation

```bash
pnpm check:docs
```

branch: design/task-0320-per-node-flighting
pr: https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/1044
summary: "Substrate for lane isolation across all three environments. Each node gets its own deploy branch per env (deploy/<env>-<node>), each env AppSet is refactored into N per-node git generators, each catalog file declares its per-env branches. Branch head = Kargo Stage promotion lease. PR #1043 (task.0371 step 1) lands the PreSync hook deletion in parallel, eliminating the hook failure class at the source. Matrix cutover of the 3 flight workflows is task.0372."
outcome: |
  - Each of the 4 catalog files (`operator/poly/resy/scheduler-worker`) declares three per-env branches: `candidate_a_branch`, `preview_branch`, `production_branch`.
  - All three ApplicationSets (`candidate-a-`, `preview-`, `production-applicationset.yaml`) refactored to 4 git generators each — one per node, each targeting its own `deploy/<env>-<node>` branch and catalog file.
  - 12 new deploy branches pushed post-merge: `deploy/{candidate-a,preview,production}-{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}` off each env's current HEAD.
  - Substrate is a behavioral no-op: Argo reconciles the 12 new Applications (same names preserved) to the same state as before. No flight-workflow changes yet; those come in task.0372.
  - Applies uniformly — no per-env asymmetry in the failure-isolation primitive.

# task.0320 — Per-node candidate flighting

## Problem

`candidate-flight.yml` today acquires a single `candidate-lease.json` and promotes the entire built-image payload into `deploy/candidate-a` atomically. Two consequences:

1. A broken node (e.g. poly build failing) blocks flights that only wanted to touch resy — the whole overlay write is all-or-nothing.
2. Only one PR can hold candidate-a at a time, regardless of whether two PRs touch disjoint nodes.

As node count grows and team activity parallelizes, both constraints become artificial serialization.

## Outcome

- **Per-node leases.** Lease state lives per node under `infra/control/` (e.g. `candidate-lease-poly.json`) instead of a single global file. A flight takes only the leases for the nodes it's about to change.
- **Partial overlay promotion.** `promote-build-payload.sh` writes digests only for the listed targets; the rest of the overlay is untouched at its last-good value.
- **Per-node smoke + Argo wait.** `smoke-candidate.sh` and `wait-for-argocd.sh` only assert / block on the flighted subset, so an unrelated broken node doesn't fail this flight.
- **Manual node selection (v0).** `candidate-flight.yml` takes a required `nodes` input. The pr-coordinator-v0 skill specifies one node at a time per dispatch. No auto-derivation from the build manifest — a follow-up can add that once the manual model is proven.
- **Infra lever remains a full stop.** `candidate-flight-infra.yml` still touches the whole VM; v0 rule is "coordinator must not dispatch infra while any node lease is busy." No new lease-set acquire logic required.

## Non-goals (v0)

- **No auto-classifier** deriving `nodes` from the PR diff or build manifest. Coordinator specifies.
- **No multi-writer git-push race handling** on `deploy/candidate-a`. V0 relies on the coordinator's serialization (one dispatch at a time per node, rare enough globally that natural ordering works).
- **No change to release / production promotion.** Overlay promotion there already runs digest-by-digest.
- **No per-node candidate VMs.** Shared candidate-a VM; per-node leases only.

## Validation

- Flight PR A with `nodes=poly`: only poly digest changes in `deploy/candidate-a`; operator/resy digests are unchanged in the resulting commit diff.
- Flight PR B (broken poly, healthy resy) with `nodes=resy`: flight succeeds, resy is live on candidate-a, poly digest on overlay still points at last-good.
- Two dispatches for different nodes at roughly the same time: both acquire their own lease, both run; one `git push` may need a manual retry if they land simultaneously (acceptable in v0).
- `smoke-candidate.sh NODES_FILTER=poly`: asserts only poly endpoints.
- `wait-for-argocd.sh APPS=<subset>`: only blocks on the subset.
- pr-coordinator-v0 dispatch: prompts for PR + node, dispatches with `-f nodes=<node>`.

## Notes

- `promote-build-payload.sh` already reads the payload JSON — a filter pass there is the core diff.
- Lease acquire/release scripts already exist (`acquire-candidate-slot.sh`, `release-candidate-slot.sh`); extend them to a `LEASE_NAME` param or equivalent.
- Multi-node / shared-package PRs use `nodes=operator,poly,resy` to take multiple leases in one flight. Still explicit, not auto.
- Follow-up (not this task): auto-derive `nodes` from `build-manifest.json`; rebase-retry loop for concurrent push safety; lease-set acquire for the infra lever.

## Design

### Outcome

A PR touching only poly promotes poly to **any** of candidate-a / preview / production without needing resy or operator to be green. Run 24910378351 (resy's stuck Argo migrate-hook failing the whole candidate-a slot) becomes structurally impossible on all three environments simultaneously: each (env × node) has its own deploy branch, its own Argo Application, and its own verify lane. Failure in one lane cannot fail another — not because a script filters it out, but because they never share a job boundary.

Scoped uniformly to candidate-a + preview + production. No per-env asymmetry: same failure-isolation primitive applied three times.

### Architectural Frame — Kargo Primitives, GHA Substrate

[Kargo](https://kargo.akuity.io) is the Argo team's answer to exactly this problem. We adopt its primitives in-name so a future migration is free, not a rewrite — but implement them on existing infrastructure (GHA + ApplicationSet + deploy branches). **No new CRDs. No new controllers. No long-running service.**

| Kargo concept | Our v0 realization                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Warehouse** | One image per node in GHCR (`pr-<N>-<sha>-<node>`). PR #1043 retires separate migrator images — one image, period. |
| **Freight**   | An `{app-digest, source-sha}` tuple for a single (env, node) pair.                                                 |
| **Stage**     | A per-(env, node) Argo Application (`<env>-<node>`) tracking `deploy/<env>-<node>`. 12 Applications total.         |
| **Promotion** | `git push deploy/<env>-<node>` with the new digest. Ref update is atomic.                                          |
| **Lease**     | The git ref itself — non-fast-forward push fails; rebase-retry resolves.                                           |
| **Verify**    | One matrix job per (env, affected-node); each waits on its own Application only (delivered in task.0372).          |

**The branch head is the lease.** No `candidate-lease-*.json` files, no bespoke coordinator — git already solves "one writer at a time per ref" and has done so for 20 years. The original v0 outcome (per-node JSON lease files + `NODES_FILTER` env threading) is replaced by this branch-per-node model as the simpler primitive.

### Key Discoveries from the Spike

1. **`wait-for-argocd.sh` and `smoke-candidate.sh` already honor `PROMOTED_APPS`.** Zero script changes needed for per-node filtering. But we're abandoning filter-in-a-shared-script in favor of job-level isolation — PROMOTED_APPS shrinks to one app per matrix cell, so the "filtering" becomes a side-effect of the matrix shape.
2. **`promote-build-payload.sh` hardcodes four promote targets** (lines 157–160). With the matrix shape, this script no longer needs a NODES_FILTER — it runs once per matrix cell, scoped to a single app, writing only that app's digest to that app's branch.
3. **ApplicationSet templates from `infra/catalog/*.yaml`**. Adding one `candidate_a_branch: deploy/candidate-a-<name>` field per catalog file + one `targetRevision: "{{candidate_a_branch}}"` templating change = per-node branches are live. Argo already supports this natively.
4. **Turborepo is already installed** (`turbo.json` present). `turbo ls --affected --filter=...[$BASE_SHA]` is the canonical way to compute which nodes a PR touches. No hand-rolled path-diff script.

### Approach

**Solution**: Fan out `candidate-flight.yml` across a matrix of affected nodes (computed by Turbo). Each matrix cell is an independent lane: acquire-by-push → verify → smoke, targeting its own deploy branch and its own Argo Application.

1. **Per-node deploy branches.** Create `deploy/candidate-a-operator`, `deploy/candidate-a-poly`, `deploy/candidate-a-resy`, `deploy/candidate-a-scheduler-worker` from current `deploy/candidate-a`. Retire `deploy/candidate-a` after cutover.
2. **AppSet templating.** Add `candidate_a_branch` field to each `infra/catalog/*.yaml`. Template `source.targetRevision` and the generator's `revision` from that field. One existing ApplicationSet continues to produce four Applications, but each now tracks its own per-node branch.
3. **Turbo-computed matrix.** `candidate-flight.yml`'s first job runs `turbo ls --affected --filter=...[origin/main]` and emits a matrix `include:` list of affected nodes. Downstream jobs fan out over that matrix. Dispatcher may override with an optional `nodes` input for manual force-flight (rare; primary path is turbo-computed).
4. **Matrix-isolated verify.** Each matrix cell runs `promote-build-payload.sh` for its one node, pushes to its one branch, runs `wait-for-argocd.sh` with `PROMOTED_APPS=<that-node>`, and runs `smoke-candidate.sh` with the same. A sibling cell's failure cannot fail this cell — they're parallel GHA jobs, not shared `for` loops. `wait-for-argocd.sh` gains nothing; the isolation is structural.
5. **Infra lever unchanged in scope.** `candidate-flight-infra.yml` still touches the whole VM. No new coordination mechanism — humans/coordinator don't dispatch infra while any flight run is active. Document, don't enforce (v0).

**Reuses**:

- ApplicationSet + catalog templating (extending one existing field).
- `promote-k8s-image.sh` per-app overlay write (unchanged).
- `wait-for-argocd.sh` + `smoke-candidate.sh` `PROMOTED_APPS` gate (unchanged; just called with scope=1).
- Turborepo's affected-graph computation (replaces any hand-rolled node-from-diff code).
- GHA `strategy.matrix` with `fail-fast: false` for lane isolation.

**Rejected**:

- **Per-node lease JSON files + `NODES_FILTER` env var.** Original task outcome. Rejected: reinvents `git push --force-with-lease`. Branch head is the atomic lease.
- **New lock/coordinator service.** Explicit non-goal. No long-running service.
- **Hand-rolled path→node mapping.** Rejected in favor of `turbo --filter=...[$BASE_SHA]`. Turbo already knows the workspace dep graph; we'd only be recreating a worse copy.
- **New CRDs / Kargo install this quarter.** Out of scope. We mirror Kargo's primitives in directory/branch names so adoption later is a rename + install, not a rewrite.
- **Per-node matrix of single-script `promote-build-payload.sh` calls with a filter flag.** Redundant once the matrix shape gives structural isolation. Delete the `promote_target` for-loop; the matrix is the loop.
- **Retaining whole-slot `candidate-lease.json`.** Delete it. The infra lever's "no flight active" check reads GHA run state (`gh run list --workflow=candidate-flight.yml --status=in_progress`), not a file.

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA -->

- [ ] NO_NEW_CONTROLLERS: No new CRDs, no new in-cluster controllers, no new long-running services. If this design introduces any, it's wrong.
- [ ] NO_BESPOKE_LOCK: The git ref is the lease. No `candidate-lease-*.json` files. Concurrency is resolved by `git push` non-fast-forward + rebase-retry.
- [ ] AFFECTED_FROM_TURBO: The matrix include list is computed by `turbo ls --affected --filter=...[$BASE_SHA]`. No hand-rolled path-diff script.
- [ ] LANE_ISOLATION: Each promoted node runs in its own GHA matrix job with `fail-fast: false`. One node's red does not short-circuit another node's lane — verified by running the workflow on a PR where one node is intentionally broken.
- [ ] KARGO_ALIGNMENT: Directory / branch names mirror Kargo primitives (branch-per-stage-per-node = `deploy/<stage>-<node>`). A future Kargo install reuses these names, not renames them.
- [ ] ONE_APPSET_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: Still one `candidate-a-applicationset.yaml`. Per-node routing happens via catalog-file `candidate_a_branch` templating — not by splitting the AppSet into four.
- [ ] BUILD_ONCE_PROMOTE (spec: ci-cd): pr-build still builds `pr-<N>-<sha>-*` once; per-node branches only rewrite overlay digests for their one node.
- [ ] IMAGE_IMMUTABILITY (spec: ci-cd): Digest references only; no `:latest`.
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: Net new code is ~1 catalog field, ~5 lines of AppSet templating, ~30 lines of GHA matrix plumbing, plus a branch-creation one-shot. No new scripts. No new packages.
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT: Rides existing ApplicationSet + deploy branches + GHA (spec: architecture).

### Files (task.0320 scope — substrate across all 3 envs)

<!-- Unified 3-env scope per 2026-04-25 revision. Earlier draft was candidate-a-only; the resy-stuck-hook bug recurs identically on preview + production (same single-branch all-or-nothing AppSet shape). PR #1043 / task.0371 eliminates the Argo PreSync hook failure class globally, which lets this task stay scoped purely to the per-node-branch primitive. -->

- Modify: `infra/catalog/{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}.yaml` — each gains three fields: `candidate_a_branch`, `preview_branch`, `production_branch`. ~12 lines total.
- Modify: `infra/k8s/argocd/candidate-a-applicationset.yaml` — replace single git generator with 4 per-node entries. Template `targetRevision: "{{candidate_a_branch}}"`.
- Modify: `infra/k8s/argocd/preview-applicationset.yaml` — same refactor: 4 per-node git generators, `targetRevision: "{{preview_branch}}"`.
- Modify: `infra/k8s/argocd/production-applicationset.yaml` — same refactor: 4 per-node git generators, `targetRevision: "{{production_branch}}"`.
- Create (one-shot, post-merge git push): 12 branches off each env's current HEAD:
  - `deploy/candidate-a-{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}` off `deploy/candidate-a`
  - `deploy/preview-{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}` off `deploy/preview`
  - `deploy/production-{operator,poly,resy,scheduler-worker}` off `deploy/production`
    Done via scripted loop at merge time, not in a workflow. Additive — no mutation of existing refs.
- Test: each of the 12 new Argo Applications (`<env>-<node>`) reconciles to Healthy at the same digest set as before; no behavioral drift.

**Out of scope for task.0320** (tracked as task.0372):

- Workflow cutover: `candidate-flight.yml`, `flight-preview.yml`, `promote-and-deploy.yml` matrix fan-out.
- Deletion of `candidate-lease.json`, `acquire-candidate-slot.sh`, `release-candidate-slot.sh`.
- `pr-coordinator-v0` skill rewrite.
- Retirement of `deploy/{candidate-a,preview,production}` whole-slot branches.
- `docs/spec/ci-cd.md` rewrite.

task.0320 substrate is a **pure behavioral no-op**. Workflows keep pushing to `deploy/<env>` during task.0372 rollout; task.0320 just gives us the per-(env,node) Argo Applications as additional observers of the same state. Lane isolation lights up only when task.0372 flips promote targets to the per-node branches.

### Implementation Order

One PR for task.0320 substrate. Validatable independently of task.0372.

**PR 1 (this task) — Substrate across all 3 envs:**

1. Add `{candidate_a,preview,production}_branch` fields to all 4 catalog files.
2. Refactor all 3 ApplicationSet YAMLs to 4 per-node git generators each.
3. Merge.
4. Post-merge: push the 12 per-(env, node) deploy branches off each env's current HEAD (scripted one-shot).
5. Observe: Argo ApplicationSet controller regenerates 12 Applications (names preserved: `<env>-<node>`). Each reconciles to the same digest state it had before. No pod churn.

**Validation (PR 1):**

- Diff of `kubectl -n argocd get applications -o name` before/after: same 12 names (e.g. `candidate-a-operator`, `preview-poly`, `production-resy`).
- Each Application's `.spec.source.targetRevision` reflects its per-node branch.
- Each Application's `.status.sync.status == Synced` and `.status.health.status == Healthy` post-merge.
- No change to live pod replicas or image digests.

## Design Review (2026-04-24)

**Verdict: APPROVED.** Deletes more than it adds; branch-head-as-lease is the right primitive; matrix + `fail-fast: false` is the right isolation; Turbo-affected is the right source; no new services. Behaviorally reversible — repoint AppSet at `deploy/candidate-a` to roll back.

Net impact: ~100 LOC, mostly deletions (lease JSON, acquire/release scripts, whole-slot promote loop). PR 1 is a behavioral no-op (four branches at identical SHAs → Argo reconciles to same state), so the substrate is validatable in prod before any workflow change.

### Implementer Guardrails

Address these in PR 1 and PR 2 respectively. Each is a code-review checkbox:

- [ ] **GR-1 (PR 1): AppSet generator shape — expect 4 git generators, not 1 templated.** Argo's git generator applies one `revision` to all matched `files:`. Templating `{{candidate_a_branch}}` into `revision` from a catalog field will not work. Instead: split the single git generator into **four `generators.git` entries under the same ApplicationSet**, each with `revision: deploy/candidate-a-<node>` and `files: [infra/catalog/<node>.yaml]`. Still one AppSet resource — four generators inside it. The original design's "~10 lines" estimate is low; budget ~40 lines for the AppSet.
- [ ] **GR-2 (PR 2): Dogfood ordering — PR 2 ships on the whole-slot model.** PR 2 can't flight itself on the new lane model because the new model doesn't exist until PR 2 merges. Order: `PR 1` merges (whole-slot, no-op) → flight `PR 2` via the **existing whole-slot workflow** → merge `PR 2` → the first PR _after_ PR 2 is the first flight of the new lane model. Do not introduce a chicken-and-egg bootstrap workflow.
- [ ] **GR-3 (PR 2): GHA `concurrency` group keyed by matrix node.** Add `concurrency: { group: flight-${{ matrix.node }}, cancel-in-progress: false }` to the matrix job. Prevents parallel same-node runs from racing on `git push deploy/candidate-a-<node>` without the coordinator having to serialize. Belt for the suspenders of non-fast-forward-push rebase-retry.
- [ ] **GR-4 (landing order, external): PR #1041 merged + PR #1043 pending.** PR #1041 (runtime migrator scripts) landed 2026-04-25 but was partial — PreSync hook Job manifests + migrator image build target were NOT deleted. PR #1043 (task.0371 step 1) finishes the tail: deletes the hook Job manifests, retires `cogni-template-migrate` GHCR target, simplifies `wait-for-argocd.sh`. Ideal merge order: `#1043` → `task.0320 PR 1` → `task.0372 PR 1`. Soft dep only — task.0320 substrate is a behavioral no-op and does not touch migration machinery, so ordering with #1043 is preference not requirement.
- [ ] **GR-5 (follow-up): Harden the infra-lever pre-check before the fifth node.** `gh run list --status=in_progress` is best-effort for v0. File a follow-up task to convert to a proper lease (e.g. one global infra-lease file, or a GHA environment-based concurrency gate) before adding the 5th node. Don't let "v0 best-effort" drift into "our concurrency story forever."
- [ ] **GR-6 (uniform across envs): Apply the primitive to candidate-a + preview + production in one PR.** Asymmetric rollout (candidate-a only) leaves preview + prod with identical all-or-nothing failure mode — a broken node still blocks the others in the env that matters most (production). The primitive is simple enough that applying it 3x in one diff is smaller than two separate rollouts + the asymmetry reasoning in between. **Added after review of PR #1043 showed uniform-across-envs cleanup is achievable with the same diff shape.**

### Rejected During Review (Recorded for Posterity)

- Templating `generator.git.revision` from a single catalog field (GR-1 — Argo doesn't support it; four generators is the real shape).
- Flighting PR 2 on its own new model (GR-2 — chicken-and-egg; whole-slot flights PR 2).
- Relying solely on rebase-retry for same-node concurrency (GR-3 — free GHA primitive exists, use it).

## Plan (PR 1 — Substrate across 3 envs; workflow cutover is task.0372)

Revised 2026-04-25 after readiness scorecard showed preview + production have identical all-or-nothing AppSet shape. Prior candidate-a-only scope left asymmetric failure mode on the env that matters most (prod). Uniform 3-env rollout now; workflow cutover (matrix fan-out) remains task.0372.

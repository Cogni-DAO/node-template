status: needs_implement
priority: 2
rank: 30
estimate: 1
summary: "seccomp=unconfined on app container disables all syscall filtering. Only 3 io_uring syscalls are needed. Create a custom seccomp profile extending Docker's default."
outcome: "App container runs with Docker default seccomp + only io_uring_setup, io_uring_enter, io_uring_register added. No other syscall restrictions removed."

# App container uses seccomp=unconfined for TigerBeetle io_uring

## Problem

The TigerBeetle native client (`tigerbeetle-node`) uses `io_uring` syscalls. Docker's default seccomp profile blocks these. As a workaround, `seccomp=unconfined` was added to the app container in both dev and production compose files.

This disables **all** ~44 blocked syscalls (including `bpf`, `mount`, `kexec_load`, `reboot`, etc.), widening the attack surface if RCE is achieved in the app container.

## Fix

Create a custom seccomp profile JSON that copies Docker's default and adds only:

- `io_uring_setup`
- `io_uring_enter`
- `io_uring_register`

Reference: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/

Apply via:

```yaml
security_opt:
  - "seccomp=./configs/seccomp-app.json"
```

## Validation

```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose/runtime/docker-compose.dev.yml config | grep -A2 seccomp
```

**Expected:** `seccomp=./configs/seccomp-app.json` (not `unconfined`)

## Affected files

- `infra/compose/runtime/docker-compose.yml` — app service
- `infra/compose/runtime/docker-compose.dev.yml` — app service (added in 2a1a05b0)
- New: `infra/compose/runtime/configs/seccomp-app.json`

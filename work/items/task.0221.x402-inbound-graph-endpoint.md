## Design

### Outcome

An external AI agent with a USDC wallet can call the Cogni node's public endpoint, pay via x402, and receive an AI graph response — using the existing graph execution pipeline, LiteLLM cost oracle, and charge_receipts audit trail. No session, no API key, no signup.

### Critical Design Decision: Inbound-only x402

The spike (spike.0220) proved full x402 E2E works (inbound + outbound). But the **simplest correct P0** keeps LiteLLM + API key on the outbound leg:

```
Agent --x402 USDC--> [Cogni Node] --API key--> [LiteLLM] --API key--> [Hyperbolic]
      <--completion--             <--cost header--         <--inference--
```

**Why not x402 outbound in P0:**
- LiteLLM is the cost oracle (`x-litellm-response-cost` header) — all billing math flows through it
- Removing LiteLLM means building a new cost oracle from x402 settlement amounts (bespoke)
- The existing `commitUsageFact()` → `charge_receipts` pipeline works unchanged
- API key auth to Hyperbolic is reliable; their x402 Vercel wrapper is an additional dependency
- x402 outbound requires a signing wallet (`NODE_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`) — spec says no private keys in P0

**What changes:** Auth layer (x402 replaces session), billing identity (wallet replaces billingAccountId), preflight check (x402 verify replaces credit balance check). Everything downstream is unchanged.

### Approach

**Solution:** New public route at `/api/v1/public/x402/chat/completions` with x402 payment verification replacing session auth. Reuses the entire existing execution pipeline — same facade, same decorators, same LiteLLM, same charge_receipts.

**Reuses:**
- `chatCompletion` / `chatCompletionStream` facades (unchanged)
- `createScopedGraphExecutor` with full decorator stack (unchanged)
- `LiteLlmAdapter` for LLM calls through LiteLLM (unchanged)
- `commitUsageFact` for receipt writing (unchanged)
- `calculateLlmUserCharge` for pricing math (unchanged)
- `/api/v1/public/*` namespace — already bypasses session auth in proxy.ts

**New code:**
- Route handler that parses x402 payment, verifies via facilitator, delegates to existing facade
- `X402PaymentGate` — thin adapter wrapping `@x402/evm` facilitator verification
- `x402-billing-account.adapter.ts` — resolves/creates billing_account from wallet address
- 2 new env vars: `NODE_RECEIVING_ADDRESS`, `X402_FACILITATOR_URL`
- charge_receipts gets `x402_settlement_tx` column via migration

**Rejected alternatives:**

1. **x402 outbound to Hyperbolic (full E2E)** — Rejected because it bypasses LiteLLM cost oracle, requires a signing wallet, and adds a Vercel proxy dependency. More complex, less reliable, bespoke cost tracking. Correct for P2, not P0.

2. **New HyperbolicX402LlmAdapter** — Rejected because it duplicates `LiteLlmAdapter` functionality. LiteLLM already routes to Hyperbolic. The outbound leg doesn't change.

3. **Separate middleware file** — Rejected. Next.js App Router doesn't have per-route middleware. The x402 logic lives in the route handler, same as session auth lives in existing route handlers.

4. **`@cogni/x402-middleware` shared package** — Rejected for P0. Only one consumer (this route). Extract to package when a second consumer appears (e.g., MCP server).

### Invariants

<!-- CODE REVIEW CRITERIA — from x402-e2e spec + architecture -->

- [ ] X402_INBOUND: Payment verified via facilitator before any graph execution (spec: x402-e2e-spec, invariant 1)
- [ ] LITELLM_IS_THE_METER: Outbound still goes through LiteLLM → Hyperbolic via API key. Cost from `x-litellm-response-cost` header. (spec: x402-e2e-spec, invariant 3)
- [ ] CHARGE_RECEIPTS_IMMUTABLE: Settlement recorded with `x402_settlement_tx` column. Idempotency via `(source_system, source_reference)` unchanged. (spec: x402-e2e-spec, invariant 4)
- [ ] NO_CREDIT_BALANCE: x402 payment IS the authorization. No DB credit check for x402 requests. (spec: x402-e2e-spec, invariant 6)
- [ ] RECEIVING_ADDRESS_NOT_SIGNING_KEY: Node only verifies + settles inbound. No private key. (spec: x402-e2e-spec, invariant 7)
- [ ] PUBLIC_NAMESPACE: Route under `/api/v1/public/x402/` — bypasses session auth in proxy.ts (spec: architecture)
- [ ] CONTRACTS_FIRST: Request/response shapes defined in `src/contracts/` using Zod (spec: architecture)
- [ ] HEX_BOUNDARIES: Route → facade → features → ports → core. No shortcutting. (spec: architecture)
- [ ] CALLBACK_IS_SOLE_WRITER: LiteLLM callback still writes charge_receipts. x402 route only adds settlement metadata. (spec: billing-evolution)
- [ ] SIMPLE_SOLUTION: Reuses existing pipeline end-to-end. No new LlmService, no new executor, no new billing path.

### Key detail: Preflight credit check skip

The `PreflightCreditCheckDecorator` asks `provider.requiresPlatformCredits(modelRef)`. For x402 requests, the modelRef uses `providerKey: "platform"` (same LiteLLM adapter), but the billing context signals "x402-paid, skip credit check."

Simplest approach: the route handler wraps the check function to always pass for x402 requests. No new provider needed — the LlmService is the same `LiteLlmAdapter`.

```typescript
// In x402 route handler:
const noopCreditCheck: PreflightCreditCheckFn = async () => {}; // x402 is the payment
```

### Files

<!-- High-level scope -->

- **Create:** `src/contracts/x402.chat.public.v1.contract.ts` — Zod contract for x402 chat endpoint (extends OpenAI format + x402 headers)
- **Create:** `src/app/api/v1/public/x402/chat/completions/route.ts` — Public route handler with x402 payment gate
- **Create:** `src/adapters/server/x402/payment-gate.ts` — Thin adapter: parse 402 challenge, verify via facilitator, settle after completion. Uses `@x402/evm` server-side verification.
- **Create:** `src/adapters/server/x402/wallet-billing.adapter.ts` — Resolves billing_account from wallet address (find-or-create pattern)
- **Modify:** `packages/db-schema/src/billing.ts` — Add `x402_settlement_tx` (text, nullable) and `provider_cost_usd` (numeric, nullable) columns to charge_receipts. Add `wallet_address` (text, nullable) to billing_accounts.
- **Modify:** `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` — Add `payments_in.x402` section (receiving address, facilitator URL, chain/token config)
- **Modify:** `apps/web/package.json` — Add `@x402/evm`, `@x402/core` dependencies (server-side facilitator verification)
- **Create:** migration for new columns
- **Test:** `tests/stack/x402-chat-completions.stack.test.ts` — E2E: wallet pays x402, gets graph response, charge_receipt written with settlement tx

### Settlement Timing

**Verify-before, settle-after pattern:**

1. **Before execution:** `verifyPayment(signedPayment)` — confirms the agent's USDC authorization covers the max estimated cost. No funds move yet.
2. **After execution:** LiteLLM callback fires with actual cost → `commitUsageFact()` writes charge_receipt → x402 route calls `settlePayment(actualCost)` → facilitator transfers actual USDC to node receiving address.
3. **charge_receipt update:** After settlement, update the receipt with `x402_settlement_tx` (the on-chain tx hash).

This means the charge_receipt is written in two phases: (1) by LiteLLM callback (standard), (2) enriched with settlement tx by the x402 route. The `x402_settlement_tx` column is nullable — NULL means LiteLLM-only billing (existing behavior), non-NULL means x402-settled.

### Configuration: repo-spec (no env vars)

x402 payment config lives in `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` alongside existing payment rails — not in env vars. This aligns with how all node identity and financial config is managed:

```yaml
# .cogni/repo-spec.yaml — new section
payments_in:
  x402:
    provider: x402-usdc-base-v1
    receiving_address: "0xdCCa8D85603C2CC47dc6974a790dF846f8695056"  # reuses operator_wallet.address
    facilitator_url: "https://x402.org/facilitator"  # Coinbase-hosted (free ≤1k tx/mo, gas sponsored)
    allowed_chains:
      - Base
    allowed_tokens:
      - USDC
```

**Facilitator details:**
- The x402 facilitator is a **third-party settlement service** (like Stripe for crypto). It verifies signed payment authorizations and executes on-chain USDC transfers.
- **Coinbase-hosted** at `https://x402.org/facilitator` — free up to 1,000 settlements/month, gas fees sponsored by Coinbase.
- **Fully open source** at `github.com/coinbase/x402` — Go + TypeScript reference server (~300 lines), self-hostable with a funded wallet + RPC endpoint.
- **P0:** Use Coinbase free tier. **P2:** Self-host for full sovereignty (same pattern as DAO contract migration).

The `receiving_address` can default to `operator_wallet.address` from existing repo-spec config — same wallet that receives operator share from the Splits contract today.

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "@x402/evm": "^2.8.0",
  "@x402/core": "^2.8.0"
}
```

Server-side only (facilitator verification). NOT `@x402/fetch` (that's client-side). The node is an x402 server, not client.

## Validation

- [ ] Agent with USDC wallet can call public endpoint and get graph response
- [ ] 402 challenge returned for requests without X-PAYMENT header
- [ ] 402 challenge includes node receiving address, USDC asset, Base chain
- [ ] Payment verified via facilitator before graph execution starts
- [ ] Graph response matches existing /v1/chat/completions format (OpenAI-compatible)
- [ ] LiteLLM callback writes charge_receipt (existing flow unchanged)
- [ ] charge_receipt enriched with x402_settlement_tx after settlement
- [ ] Existing session-auth /v1/chat/completions endpoint unaffected
- [ ] Works with at least 2 graphs (poet, ponderer)
- [ ] No private keys required on the node

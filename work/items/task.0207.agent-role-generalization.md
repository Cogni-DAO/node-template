# Parameterize LangGraph Graphs for Operator Roles

## Design

### Outcome

Two new catalog entries using a shared `createOperatorGraph` factory behind a seam. Each role defined by system prompt + tools. Existing graphs unchanged.

### Approach

**Solution**: Add `systemPrompt` to `CreateReactAgentGraphOptions` + `CatalogEntry`. One `createOperatorGraph` factory wrapping `createReactAgent` (seam for LangChain v1 migration). Two catalog entries.

**Reuses**: `createReactAgent`, existing catalog pattern, existing tool resolution.

**Rejected**:

- "One factory file per role" — duplication
- "Collapse RoleSpec into CatalogEntry" — mixes graph concern with operational concern

### Invariants

- [ ] EXISTING_FACTORIES_UNCHANGED: poet, brain, ponderer, research, pr-review not modified
- [ ] CATALOG_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: new entries in catalog.ts
- [ ] FACTORY_SEAM: createOperatorGraph wraps createReactAgent — single-file migration path

### Files

- Modify: `packages/langgraph-graphs/src/graphs/types.ts` — add `systemPrompt?: string`
- Modify: `packages/langgraph-graphs/src/catalog.ts` — add `systemPrompt` to CatalogEntry, 2 entries
- Create: `packages/langgraph-graphs/src/graphs/operator/graph.ts` — factory (~10 lines)
- Create: `packages/langgraph-graphs/src/graphs/operator/prompts.ts` — CEO + Git Reviewer prompts
- Create: `packages/langgraph-graphs/src/graphs/operator/tools.ts` — tool ID constants
- Test: catalog entry validation

## Validation

- [ ] `LANGGRAPH_CATALOG["ceo-operator"]` resolves with systemPrompt + toolIds + graphFactory
- [ ] `LANGGRAPH_CATALOG["git-reviewer"]` resolves with systemPrompt + toolIds + graphFactory
- [ ] `createOperatorGraph({ llm, tools, systemPrompt: "test" })` returns valid graph
- [ ] `createOperatorGraph({ llm, tools })` throws (missing systemPrompt)
- [ ] Existing graph tests pass unchanged
- [ ] `pnpm check:fast` passes

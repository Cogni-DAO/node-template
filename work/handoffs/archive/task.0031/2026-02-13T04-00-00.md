# Handoff — task.0031: pnpm Store Seeding (remaining work)

## Context

- The `cogni-sandbox-openclaw` devtools image is built, published to GHCR as multi-arch, and running in both dev and prod compose
- Sandbox agents need `pnpm install --offline` with zero network egress — this requires a pre-populated `pnpm_store` Docker volume
- A store image (`Dockerfile.pnpm-store`) runs `pnpm fetch` to snapshot all workspace deps; its contents are extracted into the volume at deploy time
- The store image is published to GHCR (`ghcr.io/cogni-dao/node-template:pnpm-store-latest`), the deploy.sh seeding step is wired, and the smoke test exists
- **Remaining**: the smoke test has two bugs to fix before it passes green

## Current State

- **Image + compose + GHCR publish**: all done (multi-arch manifest for both `cogni-sandbox-openclaw` and `pnpm-store`)
- **deploy.sh Step 7.5**: sources `seed-pnpm-store.sh` wrapper → calls `seed-pnpm-store-core.sh` with `--image`/`--volume` args (idempotent, hash-based skip)
- **pnpm scripts**: `sandbox:pnpm-store:build`, `sandbox:pnpm-store:seed`, `sandbox:pnpm-store:seed:from-ghcr` all working
- **Key bug fixed this session**: `PNPM_STORE_DIR` is not a real pnpm env var — changed to `npm_config_store_dir` in Dockerfile, compose files, and test
- **Key bug fixed this session**: `/workspace` tmpfs was `root:root` — added `uid=1001,gid=1001` to tmpfs mount options in both compose files
- **Smoke test (`sandbox-openclaw-pnpm-smoke.stack.test.ts`)**: 3 of 5 tests pass; 2 need fixes (see Next Actions)
- **Uncommitted changes on branch** — all work is staged but not yet committed

## Decisions Made

- **Reusable seed script**: `services/sandbox-openclaw/seed-pnpm-store.sh` takes `--image` and `--volume` args — used by both local dev (pnpm scripts) and deploy (sourced wrapper). See [seed-pnpm-store.sh](../../services/sandbox-openclaw/seed-pnpm-store.sh)
- **`npm_config_store_dir` not `PNPM_STORE_DIR`**: pnpm reads `npm_config_store_dir`; the old env var was silently ignored. Changed everywhere (Dockerfiles, compose, test)
- **tmpfs uid/gid**: `/workspace` tmpfs needs `uid=1001,gid=1001` so sandboxer can write. Applied in both dev and prod compose
- **Published Images table**: added to top of [openclaw-sandbox-spec.md](../../docs/spec/openclaw-sandbox-spec.md) — 3 images documented, legacy per-arch override table removed
- **Test installs biome only** (not full monorepo): `/workspace` is 256MB tmpfs, full `node_modules` is 1.8GB — can't hardlink across filesystem boundaries (tmpfs ↔ volume)

## Next Actions

- [ ] Fix biome offline install test: verify the `--offline` flag works for a single-dep install (biome) — may need `--no-frozen-lockfile` since we generate a fresh `package.json` without a lockfile
- [ ] Fix negative control test: ensure it properly captures pnpm's non-zero exit code (the `2>&1; echo EXIT:$?` pattern may need the exec timeout bumped)
- [ ] Commit all uncommitted changes on `feat/openclaw-devtools-image`
- [ ] Run `pnpm check` — pre-existing format failures in 2 unrelated files (`tailscale-headscale-mesh-vpn.md`)
- [ ] Run full stack tests to confirm no regressions (other failures in prior run were from infra restart, not code changes)
- [ ] Consider P1: for real dev agents, `/workspace` should be a real RW volume (not tmpfs) to support full `pnpm install` + builds — tmpfs is only suitable for lightweight operations

## Risks / Gotchas

- **pnpm hardlinks don't cross filesystems**: `/pnpm-store` (Docker volume) → `/workspace` (tmpfs) forces pnpm to copy instead of hardlink. Full monorepo install (1.8GB) will always fail on 256MB tmpfs. Only minimal installs work
- **`execInContainer` has a timeout**: the `execInContainer` fixture helper defaults to 5s stream timeout; the biome test passes 30s. If install is slow, bump it
- **Entrypoint interference**: the seed script uses `--entrypoint sh` to bypass `sandbox-entrypoint.sh` (which prints socat logs to stdout and garbles command output)
- **Infra restart causes transient test failures**: other stack tests (chat-streaming, langfuse, scheduler) will timeout briefly after `pnpm dev:infra` restart — wait for services to stabilize

# Handoff — task.0032: Upgrade Cogni from Node 20 to Node 22 LTS

## Context

- Cogni pinned Node 20.x across ~20 surfaces since repo scaffolding (Nov 2025) — convention inertia, not a hard constraint
- Next.js 16.0.1 requires `>=20.9.0`; no dependency has an upper-bound excluding Node 22
- OpenClaw already runs `node:22-bookworm` — aligning eliminates the ABI mismatch workaround planned for task.0031 (devtools image)
- PR #379 targets `staging`

## Current State

**task.0032 is Done.** All surfaces upgraded, `pnpm check` passes, PR open.

Surfaces updated (20 files):

- `package.json`: volta pin → `22.22.0`, engines → `22.x`, `@types/node` → `^22` (resolved to `22.19.7`)
- `.nvmrc`: `22`
- `Dockerfile`: `node:22-alpine` (base + runner)
- `services/sandbox-runtime/Dockerfile`: `node:22-slim`
- `services/scheduler-worker/Dockerfile`: `node:22-bookworm-slim` (builder + runner)
- `services/scheduler-worker/tsup.config.ts`: target `node22`
- `platform/bootstrap/setup.sh`: guard checks `!= "22"`
- `platform/bootstrap/install/install-pnpm.sh`: `volta install node@22`
- Documentation: README, developer-setup, create-service, AGENTS.md, specs, bootstrap README

## Decisions Made

- Pinned Volta to `22.22.0` (latest Node 22 LTS as of 2026-02-11)
- `pnpm-lock.yaml` updated — `@types/node@22.19.7` replaces `@types/node@20.19.24`
- The `Unsupported engine` pnpm warning is cosmetic — pnpm reports the global Volta default, not the project-scoped pin. Fix: `volta install node@22` on each dev machine

## Next Actions

- [ ] Merge PR #379 after CI passes
- [ ] Each developer runs `volta install node@22` to update their global default (eliminates the cosmetic engine warning)
- [ ] Proceed with task.0031 (devtools image) — can now use `node:22-bookworm` directly, no native module ABI rebuild step needed
- [ ] task.0031 spec at `work/items/task.0031.openclaw-cogni-dev-image.md` — the "Node version conflict" section is already updated to reference task.0032 as resolved

## Risks / Gotchas

- **Volta global default**: Existing devs still have `node@20` as their global Volta default. The project pin overrides it inside the repo, but pnpm's engine check fires before Volta intercepts — produces a harmless warning until they run `volta install node@22`
- **Docker image pulls**: First build after merge will pull `node:22-alpine` / `node:22-slim` / `node:22-bookworm-slim` base images (cold cache)
- **CI runners**: If CI pins Node via a mechanism other than Volta (e.g., `setup-node` action), those need updating too — check `.github/workflows/`

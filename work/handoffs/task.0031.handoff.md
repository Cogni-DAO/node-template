# Handoff: Build unified cogni-sandbox-openclaw devtools image + pnpm cache volumes

## Context

- OpenClaw agents run in Docker containers but currently lack Cogni dev tooling (pnpm, correct node version) — agents can't run `pnpm check` or `pnpm test` against the codebase
- Today's `cogni-sandbox-openclaw` image is a thin layer over `openclaw:local` (node:22) adding only socat — no pnpm, no Cogni-aware tooling
- Goal: one unified image (node:22 + OpenClaw + pnpm + git + socat) that serves both gateway (long-running) and ephemeral (one-shot) modes
- Cogni workspace deps are NOT baked into the image — instead a `pnpm_store` named volume provides fast installs after first run
- This is a prerequisite for task.0022 (git relay MVP) — the git relay agent needs git + pnpm in the container

## Current State

- **Task spec is complete** — requirements, design, plan, validation all written in `work/items/task.0031.openclaw-cogni-dev-image.md`
- **Blocker discovered and resolved**: OpenClaw has a hard `process.exit(1)` runtime guard requiring node >= 22. Cogni currently pins node:20. Resolution: upgrade Cogni to node:22 first (prerequisite added to task plan)
- **Node:22 probe done**: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` of OpenClaw deps succeeds on node:20-bookworm with node:22 artifacts, but the runtime guard kills the process. No bypass env var exists.
- **Node:20 surface area mapped**: `package.json` (engines, volta, @types/node), `Dockerfile` (app), `scheduler-worker/Dockerfile`, `sandbox-runtime/Dockerfile`, `ci.yaml`, `staging-preview.yml`, bootstrap scripts — all mechanical replacements
- **No implementation code written yet** — only task definition and research

## Decisions Made

- **node:22 base** — OpenClaw's hard runtime guard makes node:20 impossible without patching compiled JS. Cogni's node:20 pin is conservative, not architectural. See task.0031 Context section.
- **No baked deps** — pnpm store volume instead. See task.0031 "Why not bake node_modules?" rationale.
- **Deterministic store path** — `PNPM_STORE_DIR=/pnpm-store` as env var + volume mount. See task.0031 Compose Changes section.
- **Orchestration-agnostic image** — image doesn't know how workspace is populated. Provider's job. See task.0031 Runtime Workspace Contract.

## Next Actions

- [ ] Upgrade Cogni to node:22 — mechanical find-and-replace (full list in task.0031 Plan, first checkbox)
- [ ] Validate node:22 upgrade: `pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, Docker build all pass
- [ ] Rewrite `services/sandbox-openclaw/Dockerfile` as multi-stage (node:22-bookworm + openclaw:local)
- [ ] Update `docker-compose.dev.yml`: new image, `pnpm_store` volume at `/pnpm-store`, `PNPM_STORE_DIR` env
- [ ] Add `sandbox:openclaw:docker:build` script to root `package.json`
- [ ] Verify gateway healthcheck passes with new image
- [ ] Verify pnpm store volume works (second install fast)

## Risks / Gotchas

- **Node:22 upgrade may surface issues** — unlikely but test thoroughly (`pnpm check`, `pnpm test`, Docker builds, CI). Next.js 16 and all major deps support node:22.
- **OpenClaw uses pnpm 10.x internally** — corepack will auto-download it for `/app` workspace. Cogni uses pnpm 9.x. Both coexist fine (different workspaces).
- **`@types/node` bump to `^22`** may surface new type errors if node:22 changed any APIs. Run `pnpm typecheck` after the bump.
- **Worktree location**: implementation lives at `/Users/derek/dev/cogni-template-devtools-image` (worktree of cogni-template)

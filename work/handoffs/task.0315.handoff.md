# Handoff: task.0315 Phase 1 — CP3.2+ (CLOB adapter + wiring)

## Where to work

- **Worktree:** `/Users/derek/dev/cogni-template-poly-copy-trade-pr-b` (separate from the main repo clone at `/Users/derek/dev/cogni-template`)
- **Branch:** `design/poly-copy-trade-pr-b` (PR [#890](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template/pull/890))
- **Env:** `.env.local` is symlinked from the main worktree — required for all `scripts/experiments/*` runs. Do not `cd` into the main worktree to work on this task; stay in the design worktree so commits land on the right branch.

## Context

- **Mission:** Polymarket copy-trade prototype. v0 (PR-A) shipped a top-wallets scoreboard. v0.1 (PR #890, this branch) is a single-wallet shadow/live mirror that ends with one real `order_id` from a hardcoded target.
- **Strategy:** stable-`decide()`-boundary design. Scaffolding (30s poll, dashboard card, env-based target) is intentionally disposable and labeled. Four phases: P1 first live order → P2 click-to-copy UI → P3 paper soak → P4 streaming (gated on P3 evidence).
- **Phase 1 = CP1–CP4 on the design branch.** Each CP is a commit; CPs ≥ 3 split into sub-CPs of ≤½–1 day each.
- **The operator Privy wallet (HSM-custodied EOA `0xdCCa8D85603C2CC47dc6974a790dF846f8695056`) is fully onboarded to Polymarket's CLOB via the direct-EOA path.** No Safe proxy, no browser ToS step. This is non-obvious and was discovered by probing; see the guide.

## Current State

> **Honest read (2026-04-17 audit):** PR #890 is a **library + migration** PR, not an end-to-end v0. No deployed code path on any running container can trigger a Polymarket trade yet. The adapter + `client_order_id` helper are imported only by local dev scripts + unit tests. The poly app's runtime does not instantiate either. CP4 is where real "the app can trigger Polymarket trades" lands.

Position live at `polymarket.com/profile/0xdcca8d85…95056`.                |

**Operator wallet on Polygon mainnet** (CP3.1 state): 20.43 USDC.e funded · ~9.99 POL gas · L2 CLOB creds registered · 3 allowances at max. A real BUY is placeable **from a dev laptop via `scripts/experiments/place-polymarket-order.ts --yes-real-money`** — NOT yet from the deployed poly container. CP4 is what closes that gap.

**What CP3.1.5 deleted** (pulled forward from original CP3.4 per design-review 2026-04-17): `PolymarketOrderSigner` port + `OperatorWalletPort.signPolymarketOrder` + CP1 stub + 4 `FakeOperatorWalletAdapter` impls + resy contract test case + duplicated `Eip712TypedData` type + `MarketCredentials.walletKey` escape hatch. `PaperAdapter.provider` is now constructor-configurable.

## Decisions Made

- **EOA path, not Safe proxy.** Confirmed by probing — Polymarket's CLOB accepts direct-EOA accounts created via `createOrDeriveApiKey`. See [docs/guides/polymarket-account-setup.md](../../docs/guides/polymarket-account-setup.md).
- **Use `@privy-io/node/viem#createViemAccount`**, not a hand-rolled shim. Private discovery during CP2 rev 4; replaces the planned `PolymarketOrderSigner` adapter path. [Commit 4e1202124](https://github.com/Cogni-DAO/cogni-template/commit/4e1202124).
- **Split CP3 into 4 sub-CPs** (3.1 allowances ✅, 3.2 adapter, 3.3 DB, 3.4 dead-surface cleanup). Each a separate commit so reviews stay small.
- **`@polymarket/clob-client` currently in root devDeps.** CP3.2 moves it to `packages/market-provider` as an optional peerDep when that package becomes its only internal consumer.
- **BUY-only prototype.** SELL orders additionally need ERC-1155 `setApprovalForAll` on the CTF contract; out of scope until SELL mirroring is planned.

## Next Actions

- [x] **CP3.1.5 — Delete dead surface** ✅ pulled forward from original CP3.4. See "Current State" above.
- [x] **CP3.2 — CLOB adapter** ✅ `PolymarketClobAdapter` at `packages/market-provider/src/adapters/polymarket/polymarket.clob.adapter.ts`. Constructor takes `ClobSigner` (viem `WalletClient`) + `ApiKeyCreds` + funder EOA. 13 mapping + adapter unit tests passing (`polymarket-clob-adapter.test.ts`). `@polymarket/clob-client` + `viem` moved to market-provider as optional peerDeps.
- [x] **CP3.2 live dry-rehearsal script** ✅ `scripts/experiments/place-polymarket-order.ts`. Gated behind `--yes-real-money` flag. Env-directed wallet (v0) — per-tenant connections are vnext. Places one BUY far-below-market + immediate cancel. **Run manually to capture a real `order_id`** before CP5.
- [x] **CP3.3 — DB migrations** ✅ `packages/db-schema/src/poly-copy-trade.ts` + `nodes/operator/app/src/adapters/server/db/migrations/0027_silent_nextwave.sql`. Tables: `poly_copy_trade_{fills,config,decisions}`. Kill-switch singleton seeded `enabled=false` (fail-closed). Applied cleanly against local poly DB. `client_order_id` helper at `@cogni/market-provider/domain/client-order-id` — pinned with a golden-vector test so CP4 executor + any future WS path share the exact same function.
  - **Pre-existing drift note:** drizzle snapshots 0024–0026 are missing (those were hand-authored SQL deltas). 0027 was generated, then hand-stripped to just my 3 poly tables; the generated snapshot correctly reflects full current schema going forward.
- [x] **CP3.2 review blockers** (rev-4 review at commit `d0366e215`):
  - [x] **B1** — per-market `tickSize` + `negRisk` + `feeRateBps` fetched before every placement (`f1e8143e8`, `2217244db`).
  - [x] **B2** — `mapOrderResponseToReceipt` rejects on `success: false` regardless of `orderID` presence (`f1e8143e8`).
  - [ ] **B3** — `mapOpenOrderToReceipt` `client_order_id`/`order_id` semantics. **Deferred to CP4** when `decide()` forces the correlation shape.
  - [ ] **B4** — Recorded-fixture contract test vs. `@polymarket/clob-client` drift. **Deferred to CP4.**
  - [x] **B5** — Dress rehearsal is post-only + asserts `filled_size_usdc === 0` (`f1e8143e8`).
  - [x] **B6** — `filled_size_usdc` unit drift (decimal USDC, not atomic) — surfaced during the live take-fill and fixed in `7cf50370e`.
- [ ] **CP4** (~4 days). Pure `decide()` + heavy unit tests (include fail-closed kill-switch branch); `clob-executor` with dynamic import gated on `POLY_ROLE=trader`; 30s poll job (`@scaffolding`, `Deleted-in-phase: 4`); SELECT-backed dashboard card (`@scaffolding`); container wiring; env vars. **This is where the adapter + helper get imported by the app and "trigger Polymarket trades" becomes a true statement about the running container.**
- [ ] **CP5** (manual, ~1h). Deploy to canary. Tail container logs to confirm migration 0027 applied. Flip kill-switch → observe target → **container-issued** `order_id` → paste into PR.
- [x] **Merge gate for PR #890 (revised 2026-04-17):**
  - [x] Local dress-rehearsal produced a real Polymarket `order_id` (`0xb14daf06…207ca9`, post-only + cancelled). Evidence in PR body + commit `2217244db`.
  - [x] Live take-fill produced a real matched `order_id` (`0x61f7ae0d…17b58a`, $5 USDC on SPY Up, Polygon tx `0xeeb76d56…a6c3`). Evidence in PR body + commit `00a9239a1`.
  - [x] PR description names the Privy HSM wallet custodian (operator EOA `0xdCCa8…5056`).
  - [ ] Migration 0027 applies cleanly on canary container boot — verify post-deploy (the one remaining item before merge).
  - **Container-issued `order_id` gate belongs to CP4+CP5**, not to this PR.

## Risks / Gotchas

- **Polygon public RPCs round-robin.** `publicnode.com` sometimes returns post-tx state from a pre-tx node. Always `waitForTransactionReceipt` first, then read with `blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber`. Hit this live during CP3.1 — see the block-pinned read in the approve script.
- **`task.0315.status` frontmatter is stale (`needs_closeout`).** The task is actually mid-flight across multiple CPs on the design branch; the field is outdated. Don't treat it as truth — branch commits are the source.
- **`.env.local` lives in the main worktree, symlinked into the design worktree.** Contains `PRIVY_APP_*`, `OPERATOR_WALLET_ADDRESS`, `POLY_CLOB_API_*`. Never commit `.env.local`. Re-run `derive-polymarket-api-keys` if rotating wallets.
- **Minimum order size on Polymarket.** Historically ~$5 notional; $1 may be below floor for some markets. Confirm against the target market during CP5 — may need `COPY_TRADE_MIRROR_USDC=5` rather than 1.
- **The `workspace:test` job in `check:fast` does NOT typecheck `scripts/`.** Script-only edits skate past `pnpm check:fast`. Always smoke-test scripts with `pnpm tsx --tsconfig tsconfig.scripts.json <file>` before commit.

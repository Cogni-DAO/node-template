# Handoff: Ledger Port + Drizzle Adapter + Schema Migration

## Context

- Part of [proj.transparent-credit-payouts](../projects/proj.transparent-credit-payouts.md) — building the epoch-based activity-to-payout pipeline
- Implements a three-layer immutability model: raw activity (immutable always) → curation (mutable until epoch close) → ledger statement (immutable once signed)
- Replaces the old receipt-signing model (ledgerIssuers, workReceipts, receiptEvents) with activity-ingestion model
- All tables scoped by `node_id UUID` per [node-operator-contract spec](../../docs/spec/node-operator-contract.md)
- Blocked by task.0093 (identity bindings); builds on that foundation for identity resolution

## Current State

- **Done:** Port interface (`ActivityLedgerStore`), Drizzle schema (8 tables), adapter (`DrizzleLedgerAdapter`), migrations (0010 DDL + 0011 triggers), container wiring, env var (`NODE_ID`), spec update, all re-exports, AGENTS.md updates
- **Done:** All 1028 unit tests pass, typecheck passes, arch:check passes, packages build + validate
- **Not done:** Drizzle snapshot files (`meta/0010_snapshot.json`, `meta/0011_snapshot.json`) — `pnpm db:generate` requires interactive prompts to resolve table renames vs creates. Must be run manually.
- **Not done:** Contract test (`tests/contract/ledger-store.contract.ts`) — deferred to next dev
- **Not done:** Migrations have not been applied to any database yet

## Decisions Made

- No `user_id` on `activity_events` — identity resolution lands in `activity_curation.user_id` (Layer 2). See [epoch-ledger spec](../../docs/spec/epoch-ledger.md)
- No `epoch_id` on `activity_events` — raw log is epoch-agnostic; epoch membership assigned in `activity_curation`
- Single `DrizzleLedgerAdapter` in `@cogni/db-client` shared by app + worker (no duplication)
- Old migrations 0010/0011 deleted (never shipped) and replaced
- `ApprovedReceipt` renamed to `FinalizedAllocation` throughout
- `signing.ts` replaced by `hashing.ts` (`computeAllocationSetHash`)
- `statement_signatures` table is schema-only — signing UX/API is a follow-up

## Next Actions

- [ ] Run `pnpm db:generate` interactively — select "create table" for each new table prompt, generating snapshot files
- [ ] Write contract test at `tests/contract/ledger-store.contract.ts` covering all `ActivityLedgerStore` methods
- [ ] Apply migrations to test DB: `pnpm dev:stack:test:setup` then verify triggers work
- [ ] Add `.env.example` entry for `NODE_ID` (UUID)
- [ ] Add `NODE_ID` to Docker compose env files and deployment configs
- [ ] Verify `pnpm check:docs` passes (currently blocked by unrelated worktree biome config issue)

## Risks / Gotchas

- **Drizzle snapshots missing**: Without `meta/0010_snapshot.json` and `meta/0011_snapshot.json`, future `pnpm db:generate` runs won't diff correctly against the current schema. Must run interactively first.
- **NODE_ID is now required**: Added to `server-env.ts` schema — all environments (`.env.local`, CI, compose) need this UUID set or boot fails. Test fixture already patched (`tests/_fixtures/env/base-env.ts`).
- **`activity_curation` freeze trigger**: The `curation_freeze_on_close()` function queries `epochs.status` on every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to `activity_curation`. Acceptable at current scale but may need review for bulk operations.
- **`pnpm lint` blocked by stale worktree**: `.claude/worktrees/ingestion-core-github-adapter/biome.json` causes biome to error. Not related to this task — another dev's active worktree.

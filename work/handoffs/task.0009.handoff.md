# Handoff: Sandbox Git-Sync Mount (P0) + OpenClaw Workspace Config

## Goal

Give OpenClaw gateway agent read-only access to the git-synced codebase (`repo_data` volume) and a writable scratch workspace.

## Status: ~90% done

### Completed

1. **docker-compose.dev.yml** — `openclaw-gateway` now mounts `repo_data:/repo:ro` + `/workspace` tmpfs (writable)
2. **sandbox-graph.provider.ts** — Ephemeral mode `runOnce()` now passes `volumes: [{ volume: "repo_data", containerPath: "/repo", readOnly: true }]` (was missing — the `SandboxVolumeMount` port existed but was never wired)
3. **openclaw-gateway.json** — Agent workspace set to `/repo/current` so file tools default there
4. **Stack tests** — LICENSE read (success) + LICENSE write (fail) + workspace writable + secrets isolation tests written in `sandbox-openclaw.stack.test.ts`
5. **Shared fixture** — `execInContainer()` added to `tests/_fixtures/sandbox/fixtures.ts`
6. **P1 task created** — `work/items/task.0009.sandbox-repo-refresh.md` under `proj.sandboxed-agents`

### Needs finishing

- **Import cleanup in test file**: `execInContainer` import was added at top but the duplicate mid-file removal may have left the file in a messy state. Read `tests/stack/sandbox/sandbox-openclaw.stack.test.ts` and verify imports are clean.
- **`depends_on: git-sync`** on `openclaw-gateway` was commented out by user because git-sync had an auth failure (stale `GIT_READ_TOKEN`). The `repo_data` volume was pre-populated so the mount works fine. Decision needed: add it back when token is fixed, or leave it out (gateway is resilient to missing volume content).
- **Run the stack tests** to confirm everything passes: `pnpm test:stack:docker -- tests/stack/sandbox/sandbox-openclaw.stack.test.ts`

## Critical Context

- **UID 1001** alignment across git-sync, app (`nextjs`), and sandbox (`sandboxer`) — all must match or git rejects "dubious ownership"
- **`/repo:ro`** = shared read-only mirror. **`/workspace:rw`** = tmpfs scratch. Agent must never write to `/repo`.
- **OpenClaw sandbox mode is `"off"`** in config — agent runs unsandboxed, so file tools access anything the process can see. The `workspace` field controls the agent's default working directory.
- **P1 port gap**: `SandboxAgentEntry` has no `volumes` field — repo_data mount is hardcoded in `createContainerExecution()` instead of declared per-agent in the registry. See task.0009 for details.
- **Docker tmpfs masking**: Never mount volumes under `/run` — sandbox containers have tmpfs there that masks volume mounts. Use top-level paths like `/llm-sock/`, `/repo/`, `/workspace/`.

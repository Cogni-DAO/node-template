# Payments & Billing Enhancements

## Goal

Harden and extend the billing pipeline across three axes: (1) improve pre-call cost estimation to reduce false 402 rejections, (2) complete external executor reconciliation for LangGraph Server billing, and (3) build toward on-chain settlement verification for DAO-governed payments.

## Roadmap

### Crawl (P0) — External Executor Reconciliation

**Goal:** Complete the LangGraph Server billing reconciliation pipeline.

| Fix streaming billing cost in test stack — LiteLLM streaming omits `x-litellm-response-cost` header and `usage.cost` in SSE; test-stack `chargedCredits` is 0n. Live works. Investigate mock-LLM streaming cost propagation and un-skip `billing-e2e.stack.test.ts`. | Not Started | 1   | (create at P1 start) |

| Fix cents sprawl across codebase (126+ references to "cents" in payment flows — standardize on USD only; credits are canonical ledger unit, cents is unnecessary intermediate)                                                                                       | Not Started | 2   | (create at P1 start) |

### Run (P2+) — Credit Holds & On-Chain Verification

**Goal:** Soft reservations, on-chain settlement, multi-provider support.

| Deliverable                                                                                                                 | Status      | Est | Work Item            |

## Constraints

- Post-call billing NEVER blocks user response (invariant from billing-evolution spec)
- `commitUsageFact()` is the only path to write charge_receipts (ONE_LEDGER_WRITER)
- Server controls identity — `billingAccountId` / `end_user` is server-derived, never client-provided
- `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` remains single source of truth for allowed providers and DAO receiving address

## Dependencies

- [ ] LiteLLM `/spend/logs` API reliability for reconciliation
- [ ] Ponder or equivalent on-chain indexer for P2
- [ ] DAO key infrastructure for additional payment providers

## As-Built Specs

- [billing-evolution.md](../../docs/spec/billing-evolution.md) — charge receipt schema, credit unit standard, single billing path
- [external-executor-billing.md](../../docs/spec/external-executor-billing.md) — async reconciliation design, end_user correlation
- [dao-enforcement.md](../../docs/spec/dao-enforcement.md) — DAO financial rails, widget payment invariants
- [activity-metrics.md](../../docs/spec/activity-metrics.md) — activity dashboard join, preflight gating model
- [payments-design.md](../../docs/spec/payments-design.md) — USDC payment system, state machine, OnChainVerifier port, persistence

## Design Notes

Content aggregated from original `docs/BILLING_EVOLUTION.md` (Known Issues + Future Work), `docs/EXTERNAL_EXECUTOR_BILLING.md` (P0 remaining + P1 hardening), and `docs/DAO_ENFORCEMENT.md` (Section 5: future DAO hardening) during docs migration.

**Known issue from BILLING_EVOLUTION (resolved):** Activity reporting previously showed zeros — fixed by joining `charged_credits` from `charge_receipts` with LiteLLM telemetry by `litellm_call_id`.

**From PAYMENTS_DESIGN.md:** Phase 4 operational hardening (stuck PENDING cleanup, verification monitoring, audit log queries, RPC rate limiting, fallback endpoints) plus remaining frontend and smoke tests added to Walk (P1).

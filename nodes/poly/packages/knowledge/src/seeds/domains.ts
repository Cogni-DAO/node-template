/**
 * Module: `@cogni/poly-knowledge/seeds/domains`
 * Purpose: Base `domains` registry rows. Every knowledge entry's `domain`
 *   column references one of these; new domains can be added per-node by
 *   inserting additional rows + Dolt commit (per knowledge-syntropy spec).
 *   Inlined from the former `@cogni/node-template-knowledge` package
 *   (deleted in repo split).
 * Scope: Seed data definitions only. No I/O — the migrator (or first-write
 *   path on candidate-a) applies these.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/knowledge-syntropy.md
 * @public

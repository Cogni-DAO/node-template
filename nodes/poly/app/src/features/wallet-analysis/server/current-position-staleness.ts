/**
 * Module: `@features/wallet-analysis/server/current-position-staleness`
 * Purpose: Single source of truth for the "fresh active position" predicate
 *          applied to `poly_trader_current_positions` reads on user-facing
 *          surfaces. Replaces ad-hoc `WHERE active = true` clauses that were
 *          summing phantom rows accumulated when /positions pagination caps
 *          out for big wallets and the writer skips its complete-only
 *          deactivation path (trader-observation-service.ts:656-658).
 * Scope: Pure SQL fragment helpers. No DB IO. Both raw `sql` callers and
 *        Drizzle ORM callers need a way to apply this; export both shapes.
 * Invariants:
 *   - FRESH_OBSERVATION_ONLY: rows whose `last_observed_at` is older than
 *     STALE_POSITION_TTL are excluded from user-facing aggregations and lists.
 *   - SINGLE_PREDICATE: every consumer of `poly_trader_current_positions`
 *     that renders a user-visible number routes through this module.
 *     Internal-only enumerations (price-history asset list, market-outcome
 *     condition list, metadata projector) intentionally do NOT apply this
 *     filter — they want the full universe of observed assets, not just the
 *     fresh subset.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: work/items/bug.5020 (read-time mitigation), work/items/bug.5025
 *        (writer-side fix), work/items/bug.5026 (cross-surface consistency)
 * @public

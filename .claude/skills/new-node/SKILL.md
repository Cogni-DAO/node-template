description: "End-to-end orchestration for creating a new sovereign Cogni node. Covers the full lifecycle: intake interview, DAO formation, template scaffolding, branding, graph wiring, PR, and DNS. Use this skill whenever someone asks to create a node, add a node, set up a new node, onboard a new DAO, or spin up a new Cogni instance — even if they don't use the word 'node' exactly. This is a high-stakes, multi-phase workflow that requires careful thinking at every step."

# New Node — Full Lifecycle Orchestration

You are a node creation agent. Your job: take a node request from first contact to a reviewable PR with DNS configured. This is not a template-copy exercise — each node is a sovereign AI organization, and getting the identity right matters more than speed.

Think deeply at every phase. A bad name or misaligned mission is harder to fix than a bug.

## The Node Lifecycle

```
 1. INTAKE          — Who wants this? What's the mission?
 2. IDENTITY        — 1-word name, mission statement, theme direction
 3. DAO FORMATION   — On-chain governance via /setup/dao wizard
 4. SCAFFOLDING     — Branch, copy template, rename, wire
 5. BRANDING        — Icon, colors, metadata, homepage, chat suggestions
 6. GRAPHS          — Node-specific AI brain + tools
 7. VALIDATION      — Typecheck, dev server, manual smoke test
 8. PULL REQUEST    — PR to integration/multi-node (or staging)
 9. DNS             — Subdomain via dns-ops
```

Each phase has a gate. Do not advance until the gate is met.

---

## Phase 1: Intake

**Goal:** Understand who is requesting the node and why.

Questions to answer (ask the user, or extract from conversation context):

- Who is the requesting party? (individual, team, existing DAO?)
- What domain does this node serve? (prediction markets, restaurants, research, etc.)
- Is there an existing community or is this greenfield?
- What AI capabilities does the node need? (what should the brain do?)

Don't rush this. A node that nobody needs is worse than no node at all. If the request is vague or the mission isn't clear, push back and ask harder questions.

**Gate:** You can articulate the node's purpose in one sentence that a stranger would understand.

---

## Phase 2: Identity

**Goal:** Lock in name + mission + theme direction.

### Name rules

- **One word**, lowercase, memorable. It becomes the slug everywhere: `nodes/{name}/`, `@cogni/{name}-app`, `cogni/{name}` in the header, `{name}.nodes.cognidao.org`.
- Must not collide with existing nodes. Check: `ls nodes/`
- Must not be a reserved word (operator, template, admin, api, auth, setup, app, web)

### Mission statement

One sentence. Goes in `repo-spec.yaml` description and `layout.tsx` metadata. Examples:

- poly: "Community AI prediction trading"
- resy: "AI-powered restaurant reservations"

### Theme direction

Suggest a Lucide icon and a primary hue (HSL). Present 2-3 options with rationale. The user picks.

| Hue range              | Feel                          | Example nodes  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| 160-170 (teal/emerald) | Data, prediction, growth      | poly           |
| 20-35 (amber/orange)   | Energy, food, warmth          | resy candidate |
| 270-290 (purple)       | Creative, governance, premium | —              |
| 340-355 (rose)         | Social, health, care          | —              |

**Gate:** User has confirmed: name, mission sentence, icon choice, and primary hue.

---

## Phase 3: DAO Formation

**Goal:** On-chain DAO deployed, repo-spec fragment generated.

> **v0 path (Claude Code):** This phase directs the user to the web wizard. task.0261 replaces this with inline chat-native formation where wallet signing happens in the chat thread.

This phase requires the user's browser and wallet. You cannot do it for them.

1. Confirm the dev server is running (`pnpm dev:stack` or `pnpm dev`)
2. Direct user to `http://localhost:3000/setup/dao`
3. They fill in 3 fields (tokenName, tokenSymbol, initialHolder) and sign 2 transactions
4. The wizard returns a repo-spec YAML fragment
5. User pastes the YAML — you save it to `nodes/{name}/.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`

Read [Node Formation Guide](../../../docs/guides/node-formation-guide.md) for the detailed walkthrough if needed.

**Gate:** `nodes/{name}/.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` has valid `cogni_dao.chain_id` and `payments.status: pending_activation`.

---

## Phase 4: Scaffolding

**Goal:** Working node directory with correct package names, env vars, DB, and scripts.

This phase has real teeth — it's not just a copy. The node needs its own database, auth secret, billing endpoint, and a dev script that remaps env vars at runtime. Read [Creating a New Node](../../../docs/guides/creating-a-new-node.md) for the mechanical checklist.

### 4a. Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/{name}-node origin/integration/multi-node
```

If `integration/multi-node` doesn't exist yet, branch from `staging`.

### 4b. Copy template

```bash
cp -r nodes/node-template/ nodes/{name}/
```

### 4c. Rename packages

| File                                 | Change                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `nodes/{name}/app/package.json`      | `name` → `@cogni/{name}-app`, port in `dev`/`start` |
| `nodes/{name}/graphs/package.json`   | `name` → `@cogni/{name}-graphs`                     |
| `nodes/{name}/.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` | Already populated from Phase 3 wizard output        |

**Port assignment:** Check existing ports (`grep -r '"dev":.*-p' nodes/*/app/package.json`) and pick the next available in the 3x00 range.

### 4d. Register in operator repo-spec

Add an entry to the operator's `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` `nodes[]` array. The `node_id` comes from the DAO wizard output (Phase 3).

```yaml
nodes:
  # ... existing entries ...
  - node_id: "<uuid-from-wizard>"
    node_name: "{Display Name}"
    path: "nodes/{name}"
    endpoint: "http://{name}:{port}/api/internal/billing/ingest"
```

The `endpoint` field is currently **declaration-only** — not consumed at runtime. The billing router reads `COGNI_NODE_ENDPOINTS` env var instead (see 4e). Future: auto-generate env var from repo-spec at startup.

### 4e. Wire environment variables

Each node gets its own database and auth secret. This is the v0 env var checklist — for the full propagation story (CI, Docker Compose, deploy.sh), see `.cursor/commands/env-update.md`.

**Add to `.env.local` and `.env.local.example`:**

```bash
DATABASE_URL_{NAME}="postgresql://app_user:password@localhost:55432/cogni_{name}"
DATABASE_SERVICE_URL_{NAME}="postgresql://service_user:password@localhost:55432/cogni_{name}"
AUTH_SECRET_{NAME}="{name}-dev-secret-at-least-32-characters-change-me!!"
```

**Update existing vars in `.env.local`:**

```bash
# Append to COGNI_NODE_DBS (comma-separated list of DBs to provision)
COGNI_NODE_DBS=cogni_operator,cogni_poly,cogni_resy,cogni_{name}

# Append to COGNI_NODE_ENDPOINTS — keys MUST be node_id UUIDs (not slugs).
# The billing callback router stamps UUIDs in metadata and looks them up here.
COGNI_NODE_ENDPOINTS=...,<node-uuid>=http://host.docker.internal:{port}/api/internal/billing/ingest
```

**Also update `.env.test` and `.env.test.example`** with test-safe equivalents.

### 4f. Wire root scripts

Add to root `package.json`:

```json
"dev:{name}": "COGNI_REPO_PATH=$(pwd)/nodes/{name} NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:{port} dotenv -e .env.local -- bash -c 'DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL_{NAME} DATABASE_SERVICE_URL=$DATABASE_SERVICE_URL_{NAME} AUTH_SECRET=$AUTH_SECRET_{NAME} pnpm --filter @cogni/{name}-app dev'",
"typecheck:{name}": "tsc -p nodes/{name}/app/tsconfig.app.json --noEmit"
```

The `dev:{name}` script sets `COGNI_REPO_PATH` to the node's own directory (not repo root), then remaps per-node env vars (`DATABASE_URL_{NAME}` → `DATABASE_URL`) at runtime. Follow the exact pattern from `dev:poly` / `dev:resy`.

### 4g. Wire migration script

Add to root `package.json`:

```json
"db:migrate:{name}": "dotenv -e .env.local -- bash -c 'DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL_{NAME} tsx node_modules/drizzle-kit/bin.cjs migrate'"
```

Then add `pnpm db:migrate:{name}` to the `db:migrate:nodes` composite script (it's a sequential chain of per-node migrations).

### 4h. Provision database

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:provision:nodes    # creates cogni_{name} DB + roles via COGNI_NODE_DBS
pnpm db:migrate:nodes      # runs Drizzle migrations on all node DBs sequentially
```

### 4i. Verify template rename is complete

```bash
grep -r "node-template" nodes/{name}/
```

Every hit must be renamed. Common misses: package.json name, AGENTS.md references, import paths.

**Gate:** `pnpm typecheck:{name}` passes with zero errors. Database exists (`psql -h localhost -p 55432 -U app_user -d cogni_{name} -c '\dt'` shows tables).

---

## Phase 5: Branding

**Goal:** Node has its own visual identity.

Read [New Node Styling Guide](../../../docs/guides/new-node-styling.md) and apply all 5 customizations:

1. **Icon + name** in `AppHeader.tsx` + `AppSidebar.tsx`
2. **Theme colors** in `tailwind.css` — update `--primary`, `--ring`, `--sidebar-*`, `--accent-*` using the chosen hue
3. **Metadata** in `layout.tsx` — title + description
4. **Homepage** in `(public)/page.tsx` — hero text, CTAs tailored to the node's domain
5. **Chat suggestions** in `ChatComposerExtras.tsx` — domain-specific starter prompts

**Gate:** Dev server shows correct icon, name (`cogni/{name}`), and theme color. Signed-in sidebar matches.

---

## Phase 6: Graphs

**Goal:** Node has at least one custom AI graph (its "brain").

Create `nodes/{name}/graphs/src/graphs/{name}-brain/`:

```
{name}-brain/
  graph.ts      — Graph factory using createReactAgent or custom StateGraph
  prompts.ts    — System prompt defining the brain's personality + capabilities
  tools.ts      — Tool ID constants for capability lookup
```

Update `nodes/{name}/graphs/src/graphs/index.ts` to export the new graph.

The system prompt is the soul of the node. Write it with care — it defines how the AI behaves, what it knows, and what it refuses to do. Reference the node's mission statement.

For v0, a ReAct agent with the shared tool catalog is sufficient. Specialized tools come later.

**Gate:** Graph builds (`pnpm --filter @cogni/{name}-graphs build`) and exports are correct.

---

## Phase 7: Validation

**Goal:** Everything works end-to-end locally.

```bash
# Typecheck
pnpm typecheck:{name}

# Start (requires pnpm dev:stack in another terminal)
pnpm dev:{name}

# Manual checks:
# - Homepage loads at http://localhost:{port}
# - Branding correct (icon, colors, name)
# - Sign in works (shared auth from operator)
# - Chat loads with custom suggestions
# - AI responds (if graphs are wired to execution host)
```

**Gate:** All checks pass. No TypeScript errors, no console errors, branding matches spec.

---

## Phase 8: Pull Request

**Goal:** Clean PR ready for review.

Target branch: `integration/multi-node` (or `staging` if integration branch is merged).

The PR should include:

- `nodes/{name}/` — full node directory
- Root `package.json` — new `dev:{name}` and `typecheck:{name}` scripts
- `.env.local.example` / `.env.test.example` — new per-node env vars
- Any other env propagation changes (see `.cursor/commands/env-update.md` for the full checklist)

The PR description should include:

- Node mission (one sentence)
- What the brain does
- Screenshot of the branded homepage (if possible)
- Link to the DAO transaction (chain explorer)

**Gate:** PR created, CI passes (typecheck at minimum).

---

## Phase 9: DNS

**Goal:** `{name}.nodes.cognidao.org` resolves.

Use the [dns-ops skill](../dns-ops/SKILL.md) or run directly:

```bash
source .env.local && export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID
npx tsx packages/dns-ops/scripts/create-node.ts {name}
```

Verify: `dig {name}.nodes.cognidao.org +short @1.1.1.1`

Note: DNS will resolve but HTTPS won't work until task.0247 ships (cluster ingress + Caddy + TLS). This is expected.

**Gate:** DNS record exists and resolves.

---

## Anti-patterns

1. **Rushing identity.** A bad name sticks forever. Spend time on Phase 2.
2. **Skipping DAO formation.** Every node needs on-chain governance identity, even for dev/testing. Use Sepolia testnet if mainnet isn't ready.
3. **Copy-pasting without renaming.** Every `node-template` reference must become `{name}`. Grep for `node-template` in your node dir before moving on.
4. **Generic system prompts.** The brain's personality should be specific to the node's domain. "You are a helpful assistant" is not acceptable.
5. **Skipping validation.** The dev server must boot and render correctly before PR. Don't PR blind.

## Current Limitations (v0)

- **No production deployment.** Nodes run locally only until task.0247 ships (Docker Compose per-node, Caddy routing, per-node DB provisioning).
- **~3 GB RAM per node.** Each node is a full Next.js app copy. task.0248 (shared platform extraction) will fix this.
- **Biome doesn't lint nodes.** Catch issues via typecheck only.
- **Node typechecks not in `pnpm check` yet.** Run `pnpm typecheck:{name}` manually.

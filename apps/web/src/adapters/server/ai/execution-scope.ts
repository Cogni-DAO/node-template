/**
 * Module: `@adapters/server/ai/execution-scope`
 * Purpose: AsyncLocalStorage-based execution scope for billing and abort signal.
 * Scope: Provides per-run billing context and abort signal to static inner providers via Node-native ALS. Does not carry shared contract types — billing is app-local.
 * Invariants:
 *   - ALS_NOT_SHARED: ExecutionScope is app-local, never exported to @cogni/graph-execution-core
 *   - BILLING_SET_BY_LAUNCHER: runInScope is called by the launcher (chat, schedule, webhook)
 *   - ABORT_CHAT_ONLY: abortSignal is temporary tech debt for browser disconnect, not durable cancellation
 * Side-effects: none (ALS is process-scoped, no I/O)
 * Links: docs/spec/unified-graph-launch.md
 * @public
 */

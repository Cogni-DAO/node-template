/**
 * Module: `@ports/connection-broker.port`
 * Purpose: Port interface for encrypted credential resolution from the connections table.
 * Scope: Resolves connectionId to decrypted credentials. Handles tenant verification, expiry check, and refresh.
 *   Used by BYOExecutorDecorator (model backend) and future toolRunner (tool auth).
 * Invariants:
 * - BROKER_RESOLVES_ALL: Single credential resolution path. Adapters never do direct DB reads + decrypt.
 * - TENANT_SCOPED: Verifies connection belongs to the caller's billing account.
 * - TOKENS_NEVER_LOGGED: Resolved credentials must not appear in logs or error messages.
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: docs/spec/tenant-connections.md, apps/web/src/adapters/server/connections/drizzle-broker.adapter.ts
 * @public

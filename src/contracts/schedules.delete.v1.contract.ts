/**
 * Module: `@contracts/schedules.delete.v1.contract`
 * Purpose: Defines operation contract for deleting a schedule.
 * Scope: Provides Zod schema and types for schedule deletion wire format. Does not contain business logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - Contract remains stable; breaking changes require new version
 *   - Deletion also revokes the associated grant
 *   - Returns 204 No Content on success
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: /api/v1/schedules/[scheduleId] route, docs/spec/scheduler.md

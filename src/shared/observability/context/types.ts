/**
 * Module: `@shared/observability/context/types`
 * Purpose: Request-scoped context type for passing logger, session, and clock through layers.
 * Scope: Define RequestContext interface. Does not implement context creation or lifecycle.
 * Invariants: log is child logger with reqId, route, method bound.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: Pass ctx through facades → features → use-cases for logging. Cross-cutting observability concern.
 * Links: Used by factory module; passed through all request handlers.

/**
 * Module: `@shared/constants/system-tenant`
 * Purpose: Cogni system tenant identity constants. Naming: COGNI_SYSTEM_* = tenant-like identity, distinct from SYSTEM_ACTOR (ops/audit in @cogni/ids/system).
 * Scope: Deterministic UUID PKs for the cogni_system billing account and its owner principal. Does not contain business logic or authorization checks.
 * Invariants: IDs match the seeded records in migration 0008_seed_system_tenant.sql. All PKs are valid UUID v4.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/system-tenant.md

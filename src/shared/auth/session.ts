/**
 * Module: `@shared/auth/session`
 * Purpose: Canonical session identity type shared across layers.
 * Scope: Minimal user identity fields used by app facades and adapters; does not contain runtime behavior.
 * Invariants: walletAddress is always present (wallet-first auth); id is always DB UUID; contains only serializable primitives; no runtime behavior.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: walletAddress is required - sessions without wallet address are rejected at getSessionUser() boundary.
 * Links: app/_lib/auth/session, docs/spec/security-auth.md
 * @public

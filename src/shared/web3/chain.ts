/**
 * Module: `@shared/web3/chain`
 * Purpose: Canonical blockchain network configuration for the deployment; defines chain constants validated against repo-spec.
 * Scope: Exports chain ID, token addresses, and payment constants; does not perform network calls. EVM-only (wagmi Chain). Solana would require separate constants.
 * Invariants: Single active chain per deployment; repo-spec chain_id must match CHAIN_ID or startup fails; all web3/wagmi code imports from here.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/CHAIN_CONFIG.md, docs/PAYMENTS_DESIGN.md

/**
 * Module: `@bootstrap/graph-executor.factory`
 * Purpose: Factory for creating GraphExecutorPort implementations with observability.
 * Scope: Bridges app layer (facades) to adapters layer via bootstrap. Does not contain business logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - Facade NEVER imports adapters directly (use this factory)
 *   - Per UNIFIED_GRAPH_EXECUTOR: all graph execution flows through GraphExecutorPort
 *   - Per PROVIDER_AGGREGATION: AggregatingGraphExecutor routes to providers
 *   - Per LANGFUSE_INTEGRATION: ObservabilityGraphExecutorDecorator wraps for Langfuse traces
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: container.ts, AggregatingGraphExecutor, GRAPH_EXECUTION.md, OBSERVABILITY.md
 * @public

/**
 * Factory for creating AggregatingGraphExecutor with all configured providers.
 * Per UNIFIED_GRAPH_EXECUTOR: all graph execution flows through GraphExecutorPort.
 * Per PROVIDER_AGGREGATION: AggregatingGraphExecutor routes by graphId to providers.
 * Per CATALOG_SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: Provider imports catalog from @cogni/langgraph-graphs.
 *
 * Architecture boundary: Facade calls this factory (app → bootstrap),
 * factory creates aggregator (bootstrap → adapters). Facade never imports adapters.
 *
 * @param completionStreamFn - Feature function for LLM streaming (from features/ai)
 * @returns GraphExecutorPort implementation (AggregatingGraphExecutor)

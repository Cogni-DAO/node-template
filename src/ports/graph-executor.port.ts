/**
 * Module: `@ports/graph-executor`
 * Purpose: Port interface for unified graph execution with run-centric billing.
 * Scope: Defines GraphExecutorPort contract for all graph executors (in-proc, Claude SDK, external). Does not implement execution logic.
 * Invariants:
 * - UNIFIED_GRAPH_EXECUTOR: All graph execution flows through this port
 * - GRAPH_FINALIZATION_ONCE: Exactly one done event and final resolution per run
 * - P0_ATTEMPT_FREEZE: attempt is always 0 in P0
 * - GRAPH_ID_NAMESPACED: graphId format is ${providerId}:${graphName}
 * - UI_ONLY_TALKS_TO_PORT: UI calls listGraphs() via port; does not know providers
 * Side-effects: none (interface only)
 * Links: InProcGraphExecutorAdapter, GRAPH_EXECUTION.md, @/types/ai-events.ts
 * @public

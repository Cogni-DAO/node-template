/**
 * Module: `@core/payments/model`
 * Purpose: Payment domain entities for USDC credit top-ups with backend verification.
 * Scope: Pure domain types with no infrastructure dependencies. Does not handle persistence or external services.
 * Invariants: Status transitions are validated by rules module; amounts in USD cents and USDC raw units (6 decimals).
 * Side-effects: none (pure domain logic)
 * Notes: Client-visible states are simplified projections of internal states.
 * Links: Used by ports and features, implemented by adapters

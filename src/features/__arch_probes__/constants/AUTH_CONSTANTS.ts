 * Module: `@features/__arch_probes__/constants/AUTH_CONSTANTS`
 * Purpose: Architecture probe stub for dependency-cruiser entry point testing (constants subdirectory).
 * Scope: Provides minimal export for import graph validation. Does NOT implement real logic.
 * Invariants: Exports constant for dependency tracking only.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: Used by tests/arch/ to validate entry point enforcement via dependency-cruiser.
 * Links: .dependency-cruiser.cjs, tests/arch/entrypoints-boundaries.spec.ts

/**
 * Module: `@features/payments/public`
 * Purpose: Public API surface for payment feature - barrel export for stable feature boundaries.
 * Scope: Re-exports public types and functions; does not implement logic.
 * Invariants: All public exports must be stable; breaking changes require new feature version.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: Feature consumers should only import from this file, never from internal modules.
 * Links: Part of hexagonal architecture boundary enforcement

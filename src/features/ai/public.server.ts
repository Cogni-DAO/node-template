/**
 * Module: `@features/ai/public.server`
 * Purpose: Server-only exports for AI feature.
 * Scope: Re-exports server-only services that depend on Node.js modules (prom-client, etc). Does not implement logic.
 * Invariants:
 *   - NEVER import this file from client components or "use client" files
 *   - Only import from .server.ts files or route handlers with runtime: "nodejs"
 * Side-effects: none
 * Notes: Split from public.ts to prevent prom-client from being bundled in client code.
 * Links: Part of hexagonal architecture boundary enforcement

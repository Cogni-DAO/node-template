## Skills

Run `/help` to see all available skills. Explore with `/help {skill-name}`.

**If you need workspace, runtime, or environment details**: Use `/configure-environment`

## Memory & Context

- `MEMORY.md`: Curated, container-specific context (architecture, gotchas, patterns).
- Search project docs and work items via `memory_search` (on-demand, not auto-loaded).
- Use `memory_get` to read specific sections from search results.

## Behavior

- Be concise and technical. Don't over-explain unless asked.
- When unsure, search docs or ask the user.
- Follow repo conventions: spec-first design, conventional commits, `pnpm check` before commits.

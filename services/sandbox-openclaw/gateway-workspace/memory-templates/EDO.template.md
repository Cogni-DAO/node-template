# EDO Template

One EDO per real decision. No EDO for routine work.

```markdown
## EDO: [short title]

- Event: what happened or was observed
- Decision: what we chose to do
- ExpectedOutcome: { metric: "...", threshold: "...", byDate: "YYYY-MM-DD" }
- Confidence: high/medium/low
- Owner: who checks
- Evidence: [file refs, PRs, work items]

### OutcomeCheck (YYYY-MM-DD)

- ActualOutcome: what actually happened
- Verdict: confirmed/missed/adjusted
- Next: keep / new EDO / policy change
```

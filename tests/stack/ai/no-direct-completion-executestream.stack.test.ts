/**
 * Module: `@tests/stack/ai/no-direct-completion-executestream.stack`
 * Purpose: Verify BILLABLE_AI_THROUGH_EXECUTOR invariant via static analysis.
 * Scope: Ensures executeStream() is only called from allowlisted adapter/definition files. Does not test runtime behavior.
 * Invariants:
 *   - BILLABLE_AI_THROUGH_EXECUTOR: All billable AI execution must flow through AiRuntimeService → GraphExecutorPort
 *   - Direct completion.executeStream() calls outside executor internals bypass billing/telemetry pipeline
 * Side-effects: IO (grep subprocess)
 * Notes: Complements ONE_LEDGER_WRITER. Catches call sites that would silently skip billing.
 * Links: GRAPH_EXECUTION.md, inproc-graph.adapter.ts, completion.ts
 * @public

## Purpose

Unit tests for pure domain logic with no external dependencies.

## Pointers

- [Root AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)
- [Architecture](../../../docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Boundaries

## Public Surface

- **Exports:** none
- **Routes:** none
- **CLI:** `pnpm test tests/unit/core`
- **Env/Config keys:** none
- **Files considered API:** none

## Responsibilities

- This directory **does:** test pure domain entities, rules, and business invariants
- This directory **does not:** test I/O, external services, or cross-layer interactions

## Usage

```bash
pnpm test tests/unit/core
pnpm test tests/unit/core/entities.test.ts
```

## Standards

- No I/O, no time, no RNG
- Test pure functions and business rules only
- Use deterministic inputs and expected outputs

## Dependencies

- **Internal:** src/core
- **External:** vitest

## Change Protocol

- Update tests when core domain logic changes
- Bump **Last reviewed** date
- Ensure boundary lint passes

## Notes

- Focus on testing business invariants and domain rules
- Keep tests isolated from infrastructure concerns

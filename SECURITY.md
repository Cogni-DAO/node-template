# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep the Cogni ecosystem secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities **privately** by emailing **steward@cognidao.org**.  
Include clear reproduction steps, the impact, and the affected commit or release.  
Do **not** open public GitHub issues or discussions for security matters.

We acknowledge valid reports within **72 hours** and aim to provide a status update within **7 days**.  
Once a fix or mitigation is available, we will coordinate disclosure and publish a short advisory.

## Supported Scope

- Active development branch: `main`
- Released packages with current dependency support
- Core Cogni contracts and infrastructure defined under `.cogni/`

Older or archived branches may not receive patches.

## Out of Scope

- Denial-of-service or spam-style reports without exploit value
- Vulnerabilities in dependencies not maintained by Cogni-DAO
- Issues requiring privileged access or non-public configuration

## Safe Harbor

If you follow this policy and act in good faith, we will not initiate legal action against you.  
Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting data you do not own, and do not disrupt production systems.

## Disclosure Process

Once resolved, advisories may be published through GitHub Security Advisories or the Cogni-DAO public channels.  
Credit will be given to researchers who responsibly disclose and assist in remediation.

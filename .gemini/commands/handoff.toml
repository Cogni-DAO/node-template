description = "Hand off the project to a new developer"
prompt = """
It's time to hand this project off to a new developer. Assume they have no context of the task you've been working on, but avoid over-prescibing implementation details. Focus on the goals, functional requirements, and pointers to documentation + important files + functions.

Write a handoff summary for the new agent that includes:

- The project goal, task status, and last actions you were doing
- Pointers to the most important reference files + functions related to the project
- Any additional highly relevant context

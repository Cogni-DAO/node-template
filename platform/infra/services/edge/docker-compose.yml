# Cogni Edge Stack
# Always-on TLS termination layer. Isolated from app deployments to prevent
# connection resets during deploys. Started once at bootstrap, rarely touched.
#
# INVARIANTS:
# - Never `docker compose down` this stack during app deployments
# - Only restart on Caddyfile changes or cert issues
# - Shares `cogni-edge` network with app stack for service DNS resolution

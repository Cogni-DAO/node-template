# AGENTS.md — Cogni-Template MetaPrompt

> Scope: repository-wide orientation for all agents. Keep ≤150 lines. Subdirs inherit from this.

## Mission

Provide a reproducible, open-source foundation for autonomous AI-powered organizations:

- All infra deployable via open tooling (Docker + OpenTofu + Akash)
- All accounting and payments via DAO-controlled crypto wallets
- Strict reproducibility and code discipline across all Cogni repos

## Workflow Guiding Principles

- **Spec first:** Write the plan before code. Confirm the plan with the user.
- **Compact progress:** Summarize after each step.
- **Prune aggressively:** Delete noise, keep signal.
- **Delegate cleanly:** Use subagents with narrow scopes.
- **Validate early:** Run `pnpm check` before proposing commits.
- **Update docs:** Reflect any surface changes in AGENTS.md.
- **Full Validation:** `pnpm check:full` is long running, but has CI parity. Use as last required feature validation gate.

## Agent Behavior

- Follow this root file as primary instruction; subdir AGENTS.md may extend but not override core principles.
- Never modify outside assigned directories.
- Keep context lean (<40% window); summarize often.
- Purge incorrect info instead of propagating it.

## Environment

- **Framework:** Next.js (TypeScript, App Router)
- **Infra:** Docker + OpenTofu → Spheron (managed Akash)
- **Toolchain:** pnpm, Biome, ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, SonarQube
- **Observability:** Pino JSON → Alloy → local Loki (dev) or Grafana Cloud (preview/prod). MCP via grafana-local/grafana.
- **CI entrypoint:** `pnpm check`

## API Contracts are the Single Source of Truth

- All HTTP/API request/response shapes **must** be defined in `src/contracts/*.contract.ts` using Zod
- Facades, routes, services, and tests **must** use `z.infer<typeof ...>` from these contracts instead of re-declaring types
- If the contract shape changes, update the contract file first and then fix whatever TypeScript + Zod complain about
- No other manual type definitions are allowed for those shapes

## Usage

```bash
pnpm dev                      # start dev server
pnpm dev:stack                # start dev server + infrastructure (main dev workflow)
pnpm dev:stack:test           # start dev server + infrastructure for testing
pnpm dev:stack:test:setup     # first time: create test DB + run migrations
pnpm docker:dev:stack         # start all services containerized (with build)
pnpm docker:dev:stack:fast    # start all services containerized (skip build for speed)
pnpm docker:test:stack        # start all services containerized in test mode (with build)
pnpm docker:test:stack:fast   # start all services containerized in test mode (skip build)
pnpm docker:stack             # start full stack locally (with build)
pnpm docker:stack:fast        # start full stack locally (skip build)
pnpm build                    # build for production
pnpm packages:build           # build workspace packages (tsup JS + tsc declarations)
pnpm packages:clean           # clean package dist/ and .tsbuildinfo
pnpm check                    # lint + type + format validation (fast, no infra)
pnpm check:full               # CI-parity gate: full docker build, stack launch + all test suites
pnpm check:full:fast          # Same as check:full but skip Docker rebuild
pnpm test                     # run unit/integration tests (no server required)
pnpm test:ci                  # run tests with test coverage statistics
pnpm test:int                 # Integration tests (testcontainers, no server)
pnpm test:contract            # Contract tests (in-memory, no HTTP)
pnpm test:stack:dev           # Full Stack tests (requires dev:stack:test running)
pnpm test:stack:docker        # Full Stack tests (requires docker:test:stack running)
pnpm format                   # prettier format fixes
pnpm check:docs               # lint AGENTS.md documentation
pnpm e2e                      # Black box end-to-end tests (run on pnpm docker:stack)
```

**Fast variants:** Commands with `:fast` skip Docker rebuilds, using existing images for faster startup.

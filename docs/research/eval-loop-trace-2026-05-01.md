# Eval-loop Baseline Trace — 2026-05-01

> Manual coordinator (engineering-optimizer skill) tracking two parallel dev-agent dispatches through the lifecycle. The synthetic eval loop (`task.5004`) must encode every drift surfaced here as a runnable assertion.

## Dispatch Context

| Item     | Title                                                                                   | Node     | Surface           | Expected fix shape                         |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| bug.5004 | Mirror picks wrong outcome on binary markets — token_id resolution diverges from target | poly     | normalizer module | Pass through target's `asset` unchanged    |
| bug.5005 | `work.items.patch.v1` allowlist missing `deployVerified` / `projectId` / `parentId`     | operator | API contract      | Extend allowlist; switch to `strictObject` |

Both items existed in Doltgres on preview (`https://preview.cognidao.org/api/v1/work/items/`); both were triaged to `needs_implement` P1 by the coordinator before agent dispatch.

## Drift Points → Synthetic Eval Assertions

> Each row is a runnable assertion the `task.5004` harness must encode. Format: trigger condition → expected behavior → current behavior.

### D1 — `pr` set while `status==needs_implement`

**Trigger:** PATCH `{pr:"<url>"}` on a work item with `status==needs_implement`.
**Expected:** server rejects with 4xx OR auto-advances `status` to `needs_closeout`.
**Observed:** silently accepted; status drifts for arbitrary time until agent remembers to PATCH it.
**Fix surface:** `nodes/operator/app/src/adapters/server/db/doltgres/work-items-adapter.ts` (status state-machine in PATCH handler, or contract refinement).

### D2 — No skill-invocation audit trail

**Trigger:** agent posts a PR comment matching the validate-candidate scorecard format.
**Expected:** harness can prove the agent loaded `.claude/skills/validate-candidate/SKILL.md` before producing the comment (Skill-tool invocation log).
**Observed:** no log; format-match is the only signal — could be coincidence or coordinator-prompt seeding.
**Fix surface:** harness instrumentation; not a code-side fix.

### D3 — `deployVerified:true` finalization is uncodified

**Trigger:** PR merges + buildSha includes the merge commit on the canonical env (preview/prod).
**Expected:** an explicit step (skill section or post-merge automation) PATCHes the work item `{deployVerified:true}`.
**Observed:** `contribute-to-cogni` Phase 4 stops at `status:done`; `validate-candidate` skill explicitly says "no work-item frontmatter edits" (a stale rule from the markdown-corpus era — Doltgres makes the PATCH the canonical signal).
**Fix surface:**

- Add Phase 5 to `contribute-to-cogni`: PATCH `{deployVerified:true}` after merge + buildSha confirmation.
- Update `validate-candidate` to remove the no-frontmatter-edits rule for Doltgres-stored items (the rule predates the API).

### D4 — Single-occupancy flight slot, no harness for serialization

**Trigger:** two PRs are simultaneously flight-eligible.
**Expected:** operator API rejects the second `POST /api/v1/vcs/flight` with `slot_busy` until the first lease releases, OR a queue / lease primitive serializes them.
**Observed:** coordinator (human or skill) holds the slot manually; without a coordinator, both flights would clobber.
**Fix surface:** flight-lease primitive on `nodes/operator/app/src/app/api/v1/vcs/flight/route.ts` (already partially designed in promote-skill; needs surfacing).

### D5 — Coordinator prompts not skill-anchored

**Trigger:** coordinator dispatches a dev-agent on a work item.
**Expected:** prompt references `.claude/skills/contribute-to-cogni/SKILL.md` + `.claude/skills/validate-candidate/SKILL.md` + node-skill by path; only adds dispatch-specific delta.
**Observed:** today's dispatches re-explained the lifecycle inline, polluting the audit trail and risking agent drift.
**Fix surface:** coordinator-prompt template (now memorialized in `feedback_eval_loop_coordinator_drift.md`); could be elevated to a `coordinator-dispatch` skill.

### D6 — validate-candidate skill weight for surgical bugs

**Trigger:** PR is single-axis (API-only or UI-only, no graph/family/cross-surface).
**Expected:** lightweight scorecard variant in the skill — single row, single-axis, optional family-sub-matrix.
**Observed:** skill is dense (~300 lines, multiple matrix flavors). Dev B produced a correct minimal scorecard, but only because the surgical case happened to map cleanly to "API-only ⇒ HUMAN n/a".
**Fix surface:** `.claude/skills/validate-candidate/SKILL.md` — add an explicit "single-axis surgical" path-shortener at the top.

### D7 — Lifecycle validates the FIX, not the BUG ⚠️ HIGHEST-VALUE

**Trigger:** any work item where the bug-as-described is not the bug-as-real (misdiagnosis at intake/triage).
**Expected:** an early lifecycle gate (likely `/triage` or `/research`) requires a **reproduction proof** before the bug exits `needs_triage` — a falsifiable assertion the bug exists, with the verification command + expected output.
**Observed:** bug.5004 was filed with a description that prescribed the fix ("pass through asset unchanged"). Triage routed it directly to `needs_implement` (correctly per the new skip-design rule because the fix appeared surgical). Dev A implemented exactly that fix. PR went CLEAN through CI. Validate-candidate skill _cannot catch this_ because the skill validates that the deployed fix matches the validation contract — it has no axis for "is the validation contract framed against a real bug?" The on-chain truth (tx 0x8822381b… mirrors target's actual trade; the wrong-outcome hypothesis was based on a Data-API visibility quirk) was only discovered post-PR by an independent code reviewer.
**Cost paid today:** ~3+ hours of Dev A engineering time + reviewer time + coordinator (this session) bandwidth, on a fix that's tautological under current code. Real bug (sizing asymmetry, target median $4.33 / p99 $1,333 vs our ~$5 cap) remains live and continues to bleed money.
**Fix surface — multiple, ordered by leverage:**

1. **Add a `Reproduction` block to `/bug` template + bug-creation contract.** The bug body must include a reproducible assertion: a command/query + expected output that proves the bug exists _before_ the fix lands. For bug.5004 the missing assertion was: "decode tx 0x8822381b… on-chain; expect TransferSingle TO recipient ≠ RN1 (proves wrong-outcome pipeline)." That assertion would have failed at intake — bug never gets filed.
2. **`/triage` must validate the reproduction.** Before routing to `needs_implement`, the agent runs the `Reproduction` command and confirms expected output. Routes to `needs_research` if reproduction fails or is absent.
3. **Eval-loop assertion:** synthetic harness must include a `bug-validity` axis — given a synthetic bug whose description is wrong (e.g. "the API returns 500 on /foo" but it actually returns 200), the harness must surface the misdiagnosis at `/triage` time, not after PR open.
4. **Skill edit:** add a `Reproduction Required` section to `.claude/commands/bug.md` and `.claude/commands/triage.md`. Update `/idea` template too if it can produce bugs.
   **This is the eval-loop project's highest-value assertion.** Without it, every misdiagnosed bug burns full lifecycle cost before the truth surfaces.

### D8 — Concurrent writes with no coordination

**Trigger:** two actors PATCH the same work item within the optimistic-concurrency window.
**Expected:** server enforces `expectedRevision` (or last-writer-wins is documented and logged) so writes are auditable.
**Observed 2026-05-01 00:04Z:** coordinator PATCHed bug.5004 `{status:"cancelled", outcome:"MISDIAGNOSIS…"}`; ~30s later a second actor PATCHed `{status:"done"}`. The `outcome` field survived (the second writer didn't clear it), but `status` was clobbered. No principal log records who wrote what (per D9-equivalent gap — agent identity / revocation already on the engineering matrix). Status enum also lacks `not_a_bug` / `wont_fix` — `cancelled` is the closest, but it has been used by other agents to mean "scope dropped," so signal is muddled.
**Fix surface:**

1. Add `expectedRevision: number` (optional) to `work.items.patch.v1`; server returns 409 on mismatch.
2. Add `not_a_bug` and `wont_fix` to the status enum so closing-as-misdiagnosis has a distinct terminal state from closing-as-shipped.
3. (Cross-link: requires `proj.agent-identity-revocation` to record who wrote what.)

### D9 — Stall detection / dead-agent cutoff

**Trigger:** an agent stops PATCHing the work item but does not reach a terminal status (done | cancelled | blocked).
**Expected:** harness watchdog fires after a configurable idle window (default 30 min) and either: (a) marks the item `blocked` with a stall-reason, (b) re-dispatches a fresh agent, or (c) escalates to coordinator with the last known state.
**Observed 2026-05-01:** monitor for bug.5005/bug.5004 had only a success exit (`bug.5005=done`) and an 80-tick cap (~60 min). No assertion for _stall_ — if Dev A had hung mid-implement, monitor would have run out the clock with no signal differentiating "in progress" from "abandoned." The eval loop must encode stall-detection as a first-class outcome equal to success/failure.
**Fix surface:**

1. Harness: per-stage timeout (e.g. `needs_implement` → 45 min idle → escalate). Idle = no PATCH on the work item AND no commit on the branch.
2. Operator API: optional `heartbeat_at` column on `work_items` populated by the agent at safe-points so the watchdog can distinguish "agent alive, thinking long" from "agent dead."
3. Test fixture: a synthetic agent that intentionally hangs mid-implement; assertion that the harness emits a stall event within the timeout window.

## Today's Result Summary (2026-05-01)

- **bug.5005** — happy path complete. Real bug, real fix, validated end-to-end on candidate-a. Bootstrap moment: the fix flipped its own `deployVerified=true`. Awaiting human review/merge as of EOD.
- **bug.5004** — full happy-path lifecycle ran on a non-bug. PR #1184 closed; bug status → `cancelled` with on-chain verification linked. Real divergence reframed under `task.0347` (per-tenant wallet preferences + copy-trade sizing). RN1 mirror remains disabled.
- **task.5004** — eval loop scope expanded: D7 added (reproduction-gate at /triage). D7 alone justifies the project against today's wasted effort.

## Acceptance for `task.5004`

The synthetic eval loop is "working" when, on a fresh OpenClaw container with a synthetic toy bug, the harness:

1. Walks the lifecycle by invoking the existing skills (with logged Skill-tool calls).
2. Asserts D1–D4 explicitly per stage transition.
3. Posts a final scorecard to the operator PR that triggered it.
4. Goes red on a known-broken main (e.g. revert the bug.5005 fix → assertion D3 fails at the `deployVerified:true` step).
5. Goes green within 5 min on a healthy main.

D5 and D6 are coordinator/skill-side fixes — out of scope for the eval-loop graph itself but raise its yield.

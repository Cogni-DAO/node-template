# Research: Agentic Internet — Industry Landscape & Cogni Gap Analysis

> date: 2026-02-22

## Executive Summary

The agentic internet crossed a critical inflection in February 2026. Three simultaneous events — NIST standardizing agent identity, Stripe/Coinbase shipping agent payment rails, and the Linux Foundation unifying MCP+A2A under one foundation — have created a protocol stack for autonomous agents: **MCP** (agent↔tools), **A2A** (agent↔agent), **x402+OAuth** (payments+identity). Cogni has strong architectural foundations (hexagonal ports, execution grants, billing pipeline, identity bindings) but lacks the interoperability layer to participate in this emerging network. This document maps the landscape and identifies priority gaps.

## Part 1: Industry Landscape (Feb 8–22, 2026)

### 1.1 Protocol Convergence: MCP + A2A + ACP

Three protocols are crystallizing into the agent communication stack:

| Protocol                               | Owner                                 | Direction                 | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol)       | Anthropic → Linux Foundation AAIF     | Vertical (agent↔tools)   | Equip agents with context and capabilities           |
| **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent Protocol)      | Google → Linux Foundation AAIF        | Horizontal (agent↔agent) | Agent discovery via "agent cards," task delegation   |
| **ACP** (Agent Communication Protocol) | Academic (arXiv 2602.15055, Feb 2026) | Federated                 | Zero-trust, DHT+blockchain identity, no master agent |

**Key development:** The **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** under Linux Foundation now has **Platinum members: Amazon, Anthropic, Block, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft, OpenAI**. Founding contributions: Anthropic's MCP, Block's Goose, OpenAI's AGENTS.md.

**MCP scale:** 97 million monthly SDK downloads, 10,000+ active servers, first-class support in ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, VS Code.

**MCP Apps extension:** Tools can now return interactive UI components (dashboards, forms, visualizations) rendered directly in conversations.

**Async support:** MCP working group is adding async — servers kick off long-running tasks while clients check back later. Servers will also advertise via `.well-known` URLs.

### 1.2 Agent Identity & Authentication

**NIST AI Agent Identity & Authorization** (Feb 5, 2026): Concept paper proposing demonstrations for applying identity/authorization practices to AI agents. Public comments due **April 2, 2026**.

**NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative** (Feb 17, 2026): Three pillars — industry-led standards, open source protocols, agent security research. RFI on AI Agent Security due **March 9, 2026**.

**OAuth becoming standard for agents:**

- MCP Authorization Spec standardizes **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE** for MCP resource access
- Polar Signals shipped OAuth for AI Agents (Feb 12) — MCP clients use user identity
- Stytch published agent-to-agent OAuth guide for MCP connectivity
- Auth0 launched "Auth0 for AI Agents" platform

**MCP Security Audit (Feb 21):** 41% of 518 official registry servers require **no authentication**. Registry grew from 90→518 in one month, outpacing security.

### 1.3 Agent Commerce & Payments

**Stripe x402 on Base (Feb 11):** HTTP 402 "Payment Required" revived — agent hits paid API, gets 402 with payment request, pays in USDC on Base, access granted. Supports micropayments for APIs, data, compute.

**Coinbase Agentic Wallets (Feb 11):** First wallet infrastructure built for AI agents — agents independently hold funds, send payments, trade tokens, earn yield. Deploy+fund agent in <2 minutes via CLI. Programmable guardrails (session caps, transaction limits). Built on x402 (50M transactions since launch).

**Stripe Agentic Commerce Suite:** Businesses connect product catalogs to Stripe, select AI agents to sell through. Early adopters: Coach, Kate Spade, URBN (Anthropologie, Free People, Urban Outfitters), Revolve. Omnitalk interview (Feb 19) discusses retailer adoption.

**Solana followed:** lobster.cash by Crossmint provides AI agent autonomous wallets on Solana.

**x402 limitation:** x402 is designed for request/response payment gating (pay-per-call). It does not natively support streaming token billing with dynamic amounts — our primary use case (LLM inference where cost is determined by token consumption during a stream). Our billing pipeline (LiteLLM proxy audit → `charge_receipts`) remains the right pattern for AI token costs. x402 is relevant for _non-streaming_ agent-to-service interactions (data APIs, tool calls, static resources).

### 1.4 Browser & Web Agents

- **OpenAI Operator/CUA:** GPT-4o vision + RL, 87% on WebVoyager benchmark
- **Browser-Use (OSS):** 78.7K GitHub stars, 89.1% WebVoyager success rate, cloud platform launched
- **Vercel agent-browser:** Browser automation CLI for AI agents
- **Anthropic Computer Use:** Claude controls OS as visual canvas, Chrome extension on Pro/Team/Enterprise

### 1.5 Agent Orchestration & Infrastructure

**OpenAI Responses API (Feb 11) — three major features:**

1. **Server-side compaction** — auto-compress long runs; Triple Whale's "Moby" handled 5M tokens, 150 tool calls without accuracy drops
2. **Hosted shell containers** (`container_auto`) — Debian 12 with Python/Node/Java/Go/Ruby, controlled internet access
3. **Skills** — reusable, versioned instructions mountable into containers; Glean reported tool accuracy 73%→85%

**Framework landscape:**

- LangGraph dominates for production workflows with durable execution
- CrewAI hitting scaling walls at 6-12 months
- 86% of copilot spending ($7.2B) now goes to agent-based systems

**Agent-native compute:**

- **Daytona** raised $24M Series A (Feb 6) — 27-90ms provisioning, "replace human cloud with agent cloud"
- **Sprites.dev** (Fly.io) — stateful sandboxes on Firecracker microVMs with checkpoint/restore
- **E2B** — market leader, 150ms Firecracker startup, 24hr session limit

## Part 3: Gap Analysis — Existing Projects Mapped to Industry Trends

### 3.1 MCP Server — `proj.tool-use-evolution` P2

**Industry signal:** MCP is THE standard. 97M monthly SDK downloads. Every major AI platform supports it. Google Cloud now ships fully-managed MCP servers.

**Our state:** MCP implementation is scoped as P2 (Run phase) of `proj.tool-use-evolution`. Deliverables include `McpToolProvider`, `tools/list` discovery, `MCP_UNTRUSTED_BY_DEFAULT` invariant. The `proj.claude-sdk-adapter` P1 also depends on MCP bridge (`createCogniMcpBridge`).

**Recommendation: ELEVATE TO P0.** MCP is no longer a "nice to have" — it's the minimum viable interoperability layer. Our hexagonal architecture makes this straightforward: every contract in `src/contracts/**` maps to an MCP tool. The stub exists. This should be the highest-priority interoperability work.

### 3.2 Agent Identity — `proj.agent-registry` (Paused) + `proj.decentralized-identity` (Active)

**Industry signal:** NIST is standardizing. OAuth 2.1 + PKCE is the MCP auth standard. A2A uses "agent cards" for discovery. 41% of MCP servers have no auth — the industry is scrambling to fix this.

**Our state:** `proj.agent-registry` is **Paused at Priority 2**. P0 (discovery) is done via `AgentCatalogPort`. P1 (registration documents, `AgentIdentityPort`, `agent_registrations` table) is not started. `proj.decentralized-identity` is Active with user bindings shipping (task.0089). `proj.rbac-hardening` has `agent:{id}` actor types and OBO delegation.

**Recommendation: UNPAUSE `proj.agent-registry` and ELEVATE.** The Registration Track P0 (offchain `AgentRegistrationDocument` + content hash) aligns directly with A2A agent cards. Our identity model already has the five primitives (node, scope, user, billing, DAO). We need to extend it so agents are first-class identity holders that can obtain and present OAuth tokens. This is a prerequisite for MCP server auth.

### 3.3 Agent Payments — `proj.ai-operator-wallet` (Active)

**Industry signal:** Stripe x402 + Coinbase Agentic Wallets shipped simultaneously on Feb 11. Agents can now hold funds and pay for services. USDC on Base is the payment rail.

**Our state:** `proj.ai-operator-wallet` is Active at Priority 1. x402 integration is explicitly scoped as P2+ ("x402 integration for AI-to-service micropayments"). P0 covers Privy-managed operator wallet, Splits contract, OpenRouter crypto top-up. P2+ covers autonomous top-up and on-chain spending limits.

**Recommendation: KEEP PRIORITY, WATCH x402.** The P0 wallet work (Privy-managed wallet, Splits, OpenRouter top-up) is the right foundation. x402 is relevant for non-streaming agent-to-service interactions (data APIs, tool calls) but does NOT support our primary cost center: streaming LLM token billing with dynamic amounts. Our LiteLLM proxy audit pipeline remains correct for AI inference costs. x402 inbound support (gating access to our MCP tools for fixed-price calls) is worth evaluating at P1, but don't over-invest until the protocol matures for streaming use cases.

### 3.4 Webhook Ingestion — `proj.unified-graph-launch` P2 + `proj.governance-agents` P0

**Industry signal:** Real-time event-driven architecture is table stakes. Agent-to-agent communication is increasingly async (MCP working group adding async support). Webhooks are the glue.

**Our state:** Scattered across projects. `proj.unified-graph-launch` has webhook triggers at P2. `proj.governance-agents` has CloudEvents signal ingestion at P0. `proj.vcs-integration` has git-daemon webhook handling at P1. `proj.transparent-credit-payouts` (task.0097, In Progress) has GitHub/Discord source adapters.

**Recommendation: CONSOLIDATE.** The ingestion work happening in task.0097 is the right starting point. When `proj.governance-agents` P0 begins, the CloudEvents + `signal_events` infrastructure should be designed to also serve as the webhook substrate for MCP async and A2A task delegation.

### 3.5 Thread Persistence — `proj.thread-persistence` (P0 Done)

**Industry signal:** OpenAI's server-side compaction handles 5M tokens and 150 tool calls. Long-running agents need durable state.

**Our state:** P0 is done (`ai_threads` table, port+adapter). P1 is partially done (client migration, thread list UI). Missing: LangGraph routing, gateway streaming enrichment, GDPR deletion.

**Recommendation: CONTINUE AS-IS.** P1 completion is important but not blocking for interoperability. The remaining LangGraph routing work should be prioritized when cross-agent delegation work begins.

### 3.6 Autonomous Decision-Making — `proj.governance-agents` + `proj.system-tenant-governance`

**Industry signal:** The industry is moving fast toward proactive agents (Operator, CUA, browser agents). But the constraint `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED_MVP` is exactly right for now — NIST's standards initiative is about safe autonomy, not unconstrained autonomy.

**Our state:** Foundation being laid — system tenant exists, governance scheduling done, HIL contract designed. Actual autonomous execution is P2+.

**Recommendation: KEEP GATED.** The governance-agents project's signal→incident→brief→human-review pipeline is well-designed. Don't rush past human review gates. Focus interoperability work (MCP, A2A, x402) first — autonomous decision-making is more valuable when the agent can actually interact with external services.

---

## Part 4: Recommended New Project

### `proj.agentic-interop` — Agent Interoperability Layer

The existing projects cover pieces of the interoperability puzzle, but no single project owns the end-to-end story of making Cogni agents addressable, authenticated, and economically active on the agentic internet. A coordinating project is needed.

**Scope:** The protocol + identity + payment surface that makes Cogni agents participants in the agentic internet.

**Walk (P0) — Become Addressable:**

- Implement MCP server from `server.stub.ts` (pull from `proj.tool-use-evolution` P2)
- Auto-generate MCP tools 1:1 from `src/contracts/**` with auth guards
- OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for MCP resource access (pull from MCP auth spec)
- Publish `.well-known/agent.json` agent card (pull from `proj.agent-registry`)
- **Depends on:** `proj.tool-use-evolution` P0-P1 (semantic tool types, tool policy)
- **Depends on:** `proj.rbac-hardening` (agent actor types for auth)

**Run (P1) — Become Interoperable:**

- A2A agent card schema aligned with `AgentRegistrationDocument`
- MCP client capability — agents can discover and call external MCP servers
- Evaluate x402 for fixed-price MCP tool gating (non-streaming use cases only)
- Webhook substrate for MCP async operations
- **Depends on:** `proj.ai-operator-wallet` P0 (wallet infrastructure)
- **Depends on:** `proj.tenant-connections` P1 (OAuth credential brokering)

**Fly (P2) — Become Autonomous:**

- x402 outbound for non-streaming services (data APIs, tool calls)
- A2A task delegation — cross-agent work routing
- Cross-system agent delegation (LangGraph ↔ OpenClaw via MCP/A2A)
- Agent reputation/trust signals from `proj.agent-registry` P2
- **Depends on:** `proj.governance-agents` P0 (signal infrastructure)
- **Depends on:** `proj.thread-persistence` P1 (durable agent state)

**Invariants:**

- `MCP_UNTRUSTED_BY_DEFAULT` — external MCP tools not auto-enabled (from `proj.tool-use-evolution`)
- `HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED_MVP` — autonomous spending/delegation requires human approval initially
- `AGENT_IDENTITY_REQUIRED` — all outbound agent actions must carry verifiable identity
- `X402_BUDGET_ENFORCED` — all agent payments bounded by execution grant budgets

**Key external dependencies:**

- NIST RFI on AI Agent Security (due March 9, 2026) — align identity model
- NIST Identity & Authorization paper (due April 2, 2026) — inform OAuth approach
- MCP async spec (in working group) — design webhook substrate to be compatible
- A2A protocol spec (Linux Foundation) — align agent card format

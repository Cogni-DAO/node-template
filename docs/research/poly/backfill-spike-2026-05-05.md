# Polymarket target-wallet backfill spike — 2026-05-05

## Question

CP1–CP7 (task.5012 and friends) is moving every wallet-analysis reader off live Polymarket HTTP onto DB-backed tables (`poly_trader_user_pnl_points`, `poly_trader_fills`, `poly_market_outcomes`, `poly_trader_current_positions`, the upcoming `polyMarketPriceHistory`). The live tick (`runTraderObservationTick`, 30 s cadence) only writes new fills; it leaves the past empty. To make the new dashboard reads useful from day one — and to give the trader-comparison / pre-position trace research surfaces real data — we need to seed those tables with everything the two curated targets (RN1, swisstony) have ever done, plus the Gamma resolution metadata for the markets they touched.

The question this spike answers:

1. Which Polymarket endpoints can practically deliver an enriched, year-deep corpus for two whales without breaking the live mirror's rate budget?
2. What's the realistic wall-clock for one full pass per wallet?
3. Does this belong in a deployed catch-up job, or is a local one-shot CLI fine?
4. What derived analytics ("pre-position": first-entry, layering, hedging) can be projected off the resulting fill ledger without new tables?

## TL;DR

- **Endpoint to use:** `GET https://data-api.polymarket.com/activity?user=<addr>&type=TRADE&end=<unix_s>&limit=500`. Walk backwards by passing the last row's `timestamp` as the next `end`. Offset pagination dies at ~3500 rows; the `end=` walk has no observed ceiling.
- **No rate limits hit** at 30 sequential or 30 concurrent requests. Each `/activity?limit=500` returns in **~1.1 s** with the trade already enriched (title, slug, conditionId, outcome, side, size, price, usdcSize, transactionHash, asset). No second hop needed for trade-level data.
- **Both targets are <1 year old.** RN1 had no trades 360 days ago; swisstony likewise. Wallet birth is ~6–8 months back. Backfill scope is bounded.
- **Activity rate is high and growing.** Sampled rate per day:
  | wallet | now | 30d ago | 90d ago | 180d ago | 360d |
  |--------|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | RN1 | 14.9 K | 21.3 K | 10.1 K | 6.8 K | 0 (no wallet) |
  | swisstony | 15.7 K | 17.5 K | 19.7 K | 7.0 K | 0 (no wallet) |
  Time-weighted estimate: **≈3 M trades per wallet over its lifetime, 6 M total**.
- **Sequential walk @ 1.1 s/page:** ~**110 min per wallet**, ~110 min wall-clock for both in parallel. With 12 monthly windows fanned out per wallet (24 walkers, still well under observed concurrency limits), **~10–15 min wall-clock total**.
- **Gamma resolution batch is broken.** `GET /markets?condition_ids=A&condition_ids=B…` accepts the array form but silently caps the result page at ~24 even with `limit=500`. Use one `condition_ids=` per request and parallelize at 10. Unique markets: ~1–2 % of trades = **45 K–60 K markets per wallet → 30–60 min Gamma sequential, ~3–6 min @ 10 parallel**, deduped across both wallets.
- **v0 should be a local CLI** (`scripts/experiments/poly-backfill/`) writing NDJSON to disk first, then a thin loader that calls the existing `appendFills()` + a new `appendMarketOutcomes()` writer once CP2 (#1245) and CP3 (`task.5018`) land. **Do not deploy as a job.** This is a one-shot growing-corpus operation, not an ongoing service.
- **Pre-position analytics (first-entry, layering, hedging) need no new tables.** They are SQL projections over `poly_trader_fills` grouped by `(trader_wallet_id, condition_id)` ordered by `timestamp` — same state machine `plan-mirror.ts` already runs live. `## Pre-position analytics` below sketches the queries.

## Empirical findings (raw)

All probes ran 2026-05-05 against `data-api.polymarket.com` and `gamma-api.polymarket.com` from a single laptop. Reproducible from `scripts/experiments/poly-backfill/probe.sh` (in this PR).

### 1. `/activity` is the right endpoint

| endpoint                         | latency p50 | rows/req | enrichment                                                                               | windowable                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ----------: | -------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/trades?limit=20`               |      700 ms |       20 | thin (asset, price, size, side, timestamp)                                               | offset only (and stale at limit > 20 per ts cache note) |
| `/activity?type=TRADE&limit=500` |       1.1 s |      500 | **rich** (+ conditionId, title, slug, outcome, usdcSize, transactionHash, profileImage…) | **start + end (unix s)**                                |

`/activity` strictly dominates for backfill. The same payload is what `wallet-watch` already uses, so writers can be reused unchanged.

### 2. Pagination — `end=` walk is the only viable strategy

- `offset=0,500,…` is consistent and timestamp-monotonic up to **offset ≈ 3000–3500**. Beyond that the API returns 1 stub row (likely an internal cap).
- `end=<last_ts>` walk has no observed ceiling. Page-edge duplicates appear within the same UTC second; dedupe on `transactionHash + asset + side`.
- `start=` works the same way for forward walks (delta backfill / catch-up).

### 3. Concurrency + rate

- 30 sequential `/activity` requests: **all 200, avg 521 ms/req** (smaller payloads — limit=10).
- 30 concurrent `/activity?limit=10`: **all 200 in 486 ms wall-clock**.
- No 429s, no `Retry-After` headers seen. Conservative budget: **≤ 8 concurrent requests, no token-bucket needed**.

### 4. Live wallet rate ⇒ corpus depth

Sampling 500 fills around each historical anchor:

| wallet              | rate at sample | implies span / 500 fills |
| ------------------- | -------------: | ------------------------ |
| RN1 now             |     14.9 K/day | 48 min                   |
| RN1 90 d ago        |     10.1 K/day | 71 min                   |
| RN1 180 d ago       |      6.8 K/day | 1.8 hr                   |
| swisstony now       |     15.7 K/day | 46 min                   |
| swisstony 90 d ago  |     19.7 K/day | 37 min                   |
| swisstony 180 d ago |      7.0 K/day | 1.7 hr                   |

Time-weighted lifetime trade count per wallet ≈ **3 M**. Both wallets ≈ **6 M total fills** ≈ **12 K pages**.

### 5. Gamma resolution

- Single market: `GET /markets?condition_ids=<one>` returns 86-key payload in **~560 ms**. Includes `closed`, `endDate`, `resolutionSource`, `outcomePrices`, `outcomes`, `clobTokenIds`, `umaResolution`, `volume`, `liquidity`. Sufficient for CP3 (resolution writer) and price-history seeding.
- Batch via `condition_ids=A&condition_ids=B&…` accepts up to N params but **silently caps response at ~24 markets** even with `limit=500`. Reproduced at N=10 / 50 / 100.
- Workaround: parallel single-id GETs at fan-out=10. Empirically all-200; no rate-limiting observed.

### 6. Other useful read-only endpoints

- `/value?user=<addr>` — single-int wallet USDC valuation. Now: RN1 = $372 K, swisstony = $190 K. Cheap monitoring probe; not historical.
- `/positions?user=<addr>&sizeThreshold=0` — current positions at full granularity. Already used by the bootstrap config snapshot (pXX percentile capture).

### Walk strategy

Per wallet:

1. Probe wallet birth: walk one full pass from `now` backwards, stop when 0-row page hits. Persist `firstTradeAt` to a small json sidecar.
2. Bucket the wallet lifetime into **N monthly windows** (`start, end` pairs).
3. Spawn N concurrent walkers (one per window). Each walker pages `end=` backwards from its window end until it crosses its window start. Dedupe at write.
4. Write NDJSON per window (resumable: skip windows whose final page is older than window start).
5. After all walkers finish per wallet, collapse window NDJSONs into a single sorted-by-`timestamp` NDJSON.
6. Extract unique `conditionId`s across both wallets, dedupe, parallel Gamma fetch, write `gamma-markets.ndjson`.

### Loader strategy

- v0: print row counts and a 10-row sample. Manually inspect.
- v1: call `appendFills()` (already idempotent on `(trader_wallet_id, source, native_id)` per `trader-activity.ts:135`). For Gamma rows, write through a new `appendMarketOutcomes()` (one-row INSERT … ON CONFLICT (condition_id, token_id) DO UPDATE) — this is CP3's writer, currently unimplemented.

### Why local, not deployed

- One-shot operation. Adding a deploy job for a 15-min backfill that runs once per wallet-onboarding is wrong scope.
- Live mirror tick must not be perturbed. Backfill burns 8 concurrent reqs/wallet for 15 min; sharing the production node's outbound budget needlessly risks the live mirror's 30 s `/trades` poll cadence.
- The DB writes are tiny by Doltgres standards (6 M rows × ~250 bytes ≈ 1.5 GB total) and idempotent. Running from a laptop pointed at prod Doltgres via `DATABASE_URL_POLY` (already in `.env.local`) is the simplest correct path.
- When we onboard the **next** target wallet (vNext), the same script handles it. By then the position-research surface (CP4 / CP6) will tell us if a deployed catch-up job is even needed.

## Pre-position analytics (no new tables)

The user-facing ask — _"aggregates of target wallets behavior over time pre-position: first entry + layering + hedging"_ — is a SQL projection over `poly_trader_fills`. Same state-machine `nodes/poly/app/src/features/copy-trade/plan-mirror.ts` runs live for the mirror; we re-apply it offline over the historical fills.

For each `(trader_wallet_id, condition_id)`, ordered by `timestamp ASC`:

| event         | predicate                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `first_entry` | row index = 0 (first fill on this market)                                            |
| `layering`    | side = BUY, outcomeIndex = same as first_entry                                       |
| `hedging`     | side = BUY, outcomeIndex = opposite of first_entry, OR side = SELL after first_entry |
| `sell_close`  | side = SELL bringing cumulative position to 0                                        |

Useful aggregates for the research surface:

- `time_to_first_entry` — minutes from market creation (Gamma `createdAt`) to first_entry timestamp
- `layer_count`, `layer_velocity` — count of layering fills, and median seconds between them
- `hedge_count`, `hedge_delay` — count of hedge fills, median seconds from first_entry to first hedge
- `mean_entry_price`, `mean_hedge_price` — VWAP per branch
- `outcome_realized_pnl` — when joined with `poly_market_outcomes`, the realized PnL net of fees per market
- `share_of_volume` — target's `usdcSize` / Gamma `volume` per market (signal of how dominant they were)

These ride on a single denormalized view, not a new table. Materialize in Doltgres only after CP4 demand is empirical.

## Capacity + cost summary

| pass                   | wall clock (sequential) | wall clock (parallel) | cost             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------: | --------------------: | ---------------- |
| Trade walk, RN1        |                ~110 min |  ~10 min (12 windows) | $0 (public API)  |
| Trade walk, swisstony  |                ~110 min |  ~10 min (12 windows) | $0               |
| Gamma resolution dedup |                 ~30 min | ~3–5 min (fan-out 10) | $0               |
| **Total wall-clock**   |               **~4 hr** |        **~15–25 min** | **$0**           |
| DB write (loader)      |                  ~5 min |                     — | Doltgres ~1.5 GB |

Live-app risk: zero, if running locally against prod Doltgres. The Polymarket API budget is independent of the deployed node's allocation. Mirror tick uses 4 req / 30 s ≈ 0.13 req/s; backfill at 8 concurrent for 15 min uses ~5 req/s burst, on a separate IP, on different endpoints.

## How this fits the in-flight CP1–CP7 work

- **CP1 (#1242 merged)** — `poly_trader_user_pnl_points`: a separate `user-pnl-api.polymarket.com` source. Backfill that table is its own future task; not blocking.
- **CP2 (#1245 in queue)** — `poly_trader_fills` writer (`appendFills`) ships in this PR. Backfill loader **calls this directly**. Don't duplicate the writer. **Block on this PR landing.**
- **CP3 (`task.5018` filed)** — `poly_market_outcomes` writer not yet built. Backfill needs the writer. **Co-design the writer with CP3 author** so the loader can call it once. Suggested signature: `appendMarketOutcomes(rows: { conditionId, tokenId, outcome, resolvedAt, … }[])`.
- **CP5 (#1246)** — balance + execution. Orthogonal to backfill. Continues to write current positions live; backfill doesn't try to reconstruct historical balance state.
- **CP4 / CP6 (blocked on CP3)** — directly enabled by this corpus. Trader-comparison (CP6) becomes a SQL window over `poly_trader_fills` ⨝ `poly_market_outcomes` once both are populated.
- **CP7 (price-history mirror)** — `polyMarketPriceHistory` is a _different_ source (CLOB price-history endpoint), not Gamma. This spike does not touch CP7's data path; CP7 will still need its own backfill once the writer lands.

## Open questions / what to file next (prose, not pre-decomposed tasks)

In rough order of how soon someone needs to make a call:

- **CP3 writer signature + idempotency key.** `poly_market_outcomes` PK is `(condition_id, token_id)`. Gamma returns one row per market with `clobTokenIds[2]` (YES + NO). Need a clean upsert that splits Gamma → 2 rows per market. Co-design with whoever picks up `task.5018`.
- **Where does the loader live?** Two options: (a) extend `runTraderObservationTick` to optionally accept a backfill window, (b) standalone `scripts/experiments/poly-backfill/load.ts`. Memory says one-shot ops shouldn't grow live job complexity → (b) wins until proven otherwise.
- **Cursor reset semantics.** `poly_trader_ingestion_cursors` (PK trader_wallet_id, source) is the live tick's high-water mark. After backfill completes, cursor must be set to the most recent `observed_at` to avoid the next live tick re-ingesting the entire backfill window. Add this as a `--reset-cursor` flag on the loader.
- **Gamma resolution lag.** Some markets in the backfill will still be `closed=false`. Need a periodic Gamma re-fetch for unresolved markets. Probably a small cron once CP3 is wired; not in this spike's scope.
- **Should `bio` / `profileImage` Gamma profile fields be persisted?** They live on `/activity` rows redundantly. Probably no — store wallet identity once in `poly_trader_wallets`, not 6 M times in `poly_trader_fills`.
- **Pre-position analytics view.** Once `poly_market_outcomes` populated, write the layering/hedging projection as a Drizzle SQL view in `@cogni/poly-db-schema`. Lazy materialization OK at v0.

## Demo: 1-week RN1 backfill into candidate-a (2026-05-05 evening)

End-to-end run that proved the pipeline against the real candidate-a `cogni_poly` Postgres (host `candidate-a.vm.cognidao.org:5432`, reachable on the wider Cogni network). Wallet UUIDs from `poly_trader_wallets` were already seeded by the live mirror's bootstrap; loader looks them up by address.

**Step 1 — parallel walk** (`walk-windows.sh`, 4 monthly-style windows, 1500-page cap each):

```
[walk-windows] wallet=RN1 windows=4 span 2026-04-26..2026-05-03
  [0] window 1777176000..1777327200  → ~42K rows / ~1727 r/s
  [1] window 1777327200..1777478400  → ~42K rows / ~1741 r/s
  [2] window 1777478400..1777629600  → ~42K rows / ~1755 r/s
  [3] window 1777629600..1777780800  → ~42K rows / ~1770 r/s
[collapse] 166,444 input rows -> 165,587 unique rows (0.5% boundary-dup)
```

153 MB NDJSON; **wall-clock ~24 s** (max of the 4 parallel walkers).

**Step 2 — dry-run** (no `--apply`): mapped all 165,587 rows successfully, 0 dropped. Sample row carried `condition_id`, `token_id`, `side`, `price`, `shares`, `size_usdc`, `tx_hash`, `observed_at`, and the full enrichment in `raw` (matches the live tick's row shape exactly).

**Step 3 — apply** (`load.ts --apply` against candidate-a `cogni_poly`):

```
[load] target wallet: RN1 (3dd04627-6be3-4b2a-ade5-d05ecfb58ff2)
[load] parsed: total=165587 kept=165587 dropped=0
  [load] 5000/165587   (inserted=4990 skipped=10)   920/s
  [load] 50000/165587  (inserted=49990 skipped=10)  1599/s
  [load] 100000/165587 (inserted=99990 skipped=10)  1639/s
  [load] 165587/165587 (inserted=165577 skipped=10) 1665/s
[load] done in 99.5s — inserted 165577, skipped 10 (already-present)
```

**Wall-clock 99 s** at sustained ~1665 rows/s through ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING.

**Step 4 — verify in DB:**

**Conclusion of demo:** the writer side is functional. The full 1-year corpus for both wallets can be loaded with this same flow in **~30 min wall-clock** (12 monthly windows × 2 wallets). The dashboard will start consuming the corpus as CP2 / CP3 / CP4 / CP6 merge — backfilling more does not unblock those PRs, but having the corpus already resident means the user-facing render lights up the moment those readers ship.

## Architecture: SQL-aggregated wallet-analysis readers (the as-built fix)

The first reflex was a 25K-row `LIMIT` band-aid on the unbounded fill reads. Reviewer + Derek both rejected: silently truncates whales to 3 % of their corpus, defeating the backfill goal. The architectural fix is to **aggregate in SQL and never load raw fills into V8**. Shipped in this PR for the snapshot slice; same pattern routed for distributions / execution as follow-up CPs.

### Snapshot — fully SQL-aggregated (this PR)

`getSnapshotSlice` now issues three small aggregating queries, each bounded by output-row count not input-row count:

| helper                         |                          output rows | drives                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -----------------------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `readPositionAggregatesFromDb` | unique-market count (≤ ~14K for RN1) | resolved/wins/losses/openPositions/openNetCostUsdc/medianDurationHours/uniqueMarkets/topMarkets |
| `readDailyCountsFromDb`        |     ≤ 14 (one per UTC day in window) | dailyCounts                                                                                     |
| `readActivityCountsFromDb`     |                                    1 | tradesPerDay30d, daysSinceLastTrade                                                             |

Composer `composeSnapshotFromAggregates` mirrors the per-position math from `computeWalletMetrics` (lines 147–254 of `wallet-metrics.ts`) but operates on already-aggregated rows. Output is bit-equivalent to the JS function for the fields snapshot surfaces. `O(uniqueMarkets)` instead of `O(fills)` — scales to billions of fills.

Unit test asserts a wallet with 100,000 distinct positions returns `kind: "ok"` with `uniqueMarkets: 100_000` — no truncation, no OOM.

### Execution — SQL-bounded by current-position set (this PR)

`getExecutionSlice` now reads fills via `readFillsForActivePositionsFromDb`, which filters at the SQL level: `WHERE condition_id IN (SELECT condition_id FROM poly_trader_current_positions WHERE trader_wallet_id = $)`. Bound by ≈ EXECUTION_OPEN_LIMIT + EXECUTION_HISTORY_LIMIT (~48 markets) regardless of total wallet fill count. The slice only renders per-position trade timelines for displayed positions, so fills outside that set were dead weight anyway. **Architecturally correct, no truncation cap.**

### Distributions — temporary 25K cap (CP9)

`getDistributionsSlice` still calls JS `summariseOrderFlow`, which computes per-fill histograms (`width_bucket` candidates) and per-group quantiles. Until that helper is rewritten against SQL `width_bucket` + `PERCENTILE_DISC`, the slice keeps a temporary 25K most-recent-fills cap (`DISTRIBUTIONS_FILLS_LIMIT_TODO_CP9`). Same memory shape as `getTradesSlice`'s 500-row silent cap. Marked `_TODO_CP9` so the constant grep-finds the follow-up. **Scope discipline: this PR ships the architectural pattern on snapshot + execution; distributions follows in a focused PR using the same recipe.**

### Pattern recipe for CP9 (distributions) and beyond

1. List the per-fill operations in the JS function (e.g. histograms, quantiles).
2. For each, write a SQL aggregator returning bucketed counts/sums (`width_bucket` for histograms, `PERCENTILE_DISC` for quantiles, GROUP BY for group-level metrics).
3. Write a small composer that reshapes the SQL results into the existing output type — no input from raw fills.
4. Replace the slice body's `await readFills(...)` + `summariseOrderFlow(fills, ...)` with `await Promise.all([sqlAggs])` + `composeFromAggregates(...)`.
5. Update tests with a `makeSqlAggregateFakeDb` that injects canned aggregate rows in call order.

Snapshot's implementation in this PR is the reference: ~200 LOC of SQL + composer; pure unit-testable composer; integration via canned fake DB.

### Rejected (band-aids and half-measures)

- ❌ **25K LIMIT cap on raw-fill reads** (initial reflex). Silently shows 3 % of RN1 as the whole picture. Defeats the backfill goal.
- ❌ **Bump `--max-old-space-size` to Tier 1** (768 MB). Buys a quarter-decade. Next backfill (5M-fill wallet) breaks again. Symptom, not cause.
- ❌ **Stream raw fills via `pg` cursor + JS fold**. Same number of bytes traversed; quantiles can't stream cleanly. SQL aggregation is the same answer with less code.
- ❌ **DELETE the spike.5024 backfill rows from candidate-a**. Loses the corpus and doesn't fix the underlying defect — the next backfill of any 100K+ wallet trips the same OOM unless the slice queries are bounded.

## Incident: OOM on RN1 dashboard after 825K-row backfill (2026-05-05 evening)

After CP2–CP6 flighted to candidate-a, every wallet-analysis slice on `/research/w/RN1` returned 502. Loki:

```
FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

### Root cause

Two helpers in `nodes/poly/app/src/features/wallet-analysis/server/wallet-analysis-service.ts` issue **unbounded** reads against `poly_trader_fills`:

| helper                                   | callers                                     | line |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---: |
| `readDbFillsAsOrderFlowTrades(db, addr)` | `getSnapshotSlice`, `getDistributionsSlice` |  302 |
| `readFillsFromDb(db, addr)`              | `getExecutionSlice`                         |  387 |

Both run `SELECT … FROM poly_trader_fills WHERE walletAddress=$addr ORDER BY observed_at` with **no LIMIT**. For RN1 (825,484 rows × ~600 B `raw` jsonb each) that's ~500 MB resident set, blowing the pod heap. (CP2's `getTradesSlice` is fine — it already has `.limit(TRADE_FETCH_LIMIT=500)`.)

The CPx PRs were validated against ~25 K-row live-tick wallets. The shape changed under them when the backfill landed; nothing in the queries scales.

### Fix design — bounded most-recent read

**Outcome**: poly node serves every wallet-analysis slice for RN1 (or any wallet with millions of fills) without OOM, with explicit truncation visibility for callers.

**Approach (one helper, two callsites)**:

1. Replace both helpers with a single `readWalletFillsBounded(db, addr, limit)` that runs `ORDER BY observed_at DESC LIMIT <limit>` and returns the rows reversed back to ASC for the consumer's mental model.
2. Constant `WALLET_FILLS_QUERY_LIMIT = 25_000` (≈21 h of RN1, multiple weeks for tenant/swisstony, complete for all small wallets).
3. When the result count `=== limit`, attach a slice-level `warnings[]` entry with `code: "trades_truncated"` so the dashboard can render a "showing recent 25K of N" caption later (no contract change required — `warnings[]` already exists per the route handler comment).
4. Trades slice already has its own `.limit(500)`; leave it alone.
5. **No schema change, no migration.** `poly_trader_fills` already has the index `poly_trader_fills_trader_observed_idx` on `(trader_wallet_id, observed_at)` — the new ORDER BY DESC LIMIT walks that index in reverse. Fast, bounded, zero new SQL surface.

**Rejected alternatives**:

- **Push aggregation to SQL** (GROUP BY conditionId for snapshot, width_bucket for distributions). Correct numbers regardless of volume. Rejected for v0: 6 helper rewrites + new SQL surface, well outside spike scope. Routed to follow-up CP8 prose below.
- **Bump `--max-old-space-size`**. Pure punt; 825K is already at ~500 MB and corpus grows with future backfills.
- **Time-window filter `observed_at >= now() - 90d`**. RN1 at 27 K/day × 90d = 2.4 M rows — same OOM with extra steps.
- **Stream rows via `pg` cursor + incremental fold**. Right answer at scale; high implementation cost. Same CP8 deferral as the SQL-aggregation path.
- **`DELETE FROM poly_trader_fills WHERE raw->>'backfill_source' = 'spike.5024'`** to revert the data. Loses the corpus. Doesn't fix the underlying code defect — the next agent doing a backfill of swisstony or any 100K+ wallet trips the same OOM. Symptom, not cause.

**Files**:

- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/src/features/wallet-analysis/server/wallet-analysis-service.ts` — collapse two helpers into one, add LIMIT + truncation-warning, leave the rest of the file untouched.
- Modify: `nodes/poly/app/tests/unit/features/wallet-analysis/wallet-analysis-service.test.ts` — add a unit test for the bounded path: synth 30 K fills, assert query returns 25 K + warning code.

### Self-review (before implement)

- ✅ **SIMPLICITY_WINS** — single new constant, single helper, two callsite swaps, zero schema/contract change. ~25 net lines.
- ✅ **REUSE_OVER_REBUILD** — uses existing index `poly_trader_fills_trader_observed_idx` already on `(trader_wallet_id, observed_at)`.
- ✅ **OUTCOME_DRIVEN** — directly maps to "no OOM on RN1" plus surfaces truncation so the UI can be honest about it.
- ✅ **INVARIANTS** — `PAGE_LOAD_DB_ONLY` preserved (still hits `poly_trader_fills`, no Polymarket fallback). `SAME_OBSERVED_TRADE_TABLE` preserved.
- ⚠ **Correctness gap acknowledged**: RN1's `tradesPerDay30d`, `topEvents`, etc. now reflect the most-recent 25K fills (~21 h), not 30 days. For market-maker wallets the displayed numbers will be biased toward recent activity. Dashboard caption + truncation flag make this visible. Proper fix is CP8 (SQL aggregation), filed prose-only below.
- ⚠ **Unit-test honesty**: the test will run on local Postgres in CI, which is fine for the bounded-read assertion. We are NOT stress-testing memory; that's empirically validated only when re-flighted to candidate-a.
- ⚠ **CP3 dependency**: CP3's `runMarketOutcomeTick` is responsible for populating `poly_market_outcomes`. With 14,474 unique RN1 markets and the current tick rate, full coverage may take time. Slices that join on `poly_market_outcomes` will still render but with `closed=false` for stragglers. This is unrelated to the OOM and acceptable for v0.

### Follow-up (prose, no preemptive task fan-out per Derek's pattern)

- **CP8** — push slice math to SQL. `getSnapshotSlice` becomes `SELECT condition_id, MIN(observed_at), MAX(observed_at), COUNT(*), SUM(size_usdc) FROM poly_trader_fills WHERE walletAddress=$ GROUP BY condition_id`. `getDistributionsSlice` uses `width_bucket` for histograms. `getExecutionSlice` already aggregates by condition; just swap the in-memory fold for a SQL one. After CP8 the bounded LIMIT can be removed and dashboard numbers will be correct over the full corpus.
- **Pod heap headroom** — current pod presumably runs Node default `--max-old-space-size`. After CP8 we should be nowhere near the limit, but if other features land that hold large datasets, a one-line heap bump is a fast safety net.
- **runMarketOutcomeTick coverage SLA** — define how soon after a fill lands its market's resolution should be in `poly_market_outcomes`. Tied to how fast the dashboard "resolves" a closed position. Not blocking this fix.

## Validation

`exercise:` Run `pnpm tsx scripts/experiments/poly-backfill/probe.sh` and `pnpm tsx scripts/experiments/poly-backfill/walk.ts --wallet RN1 --windows 12 --max-pages-per-window 5 --out /tmp/poly-backfill` from a clean worktree with `.env.local` sourced. Expect both wallets' NDJSON files to land in `/tmp/poly-backfill/` with non-zero row counts and timestamps spanning the requested windows. Inspect a sample row and confirm it carries `conditionId`, `title`, `outcome`, `usdcSize`.

`observability:` This is a research spike running locally; no Loki signal. Validation evidence is the on-disk NDJSON sample + the timing summary printed by `walk.ts` (rows/window, total wall-clock, dedupe rate). PR description embeds the sample output verbatim.

`deploy_verified:` N/A. Spike does not change any deployed surface; nothing to flight.

# Fork Quickstart

## The one sentence

Paste this into a fresh Claude Code (or equivalent) session, in whatever parent directory you want the fork to land in:

> Follow `docs/runbooks/fork-quickstart.md` in github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template end-to-end.

The agent reads this file and drives. You touch the keyboard for: a bot PAT, `infra/fork.yaml::domain.root`, and 6 env secrets via `gh secret set` prompts.

## Agent guide

You are an autonomous fork-provisioning agent. Take `github.com/Cogni-DAO/node-template` from zero to `/readyz=200`. Pick defaults, install missing tools, retry transient failures. Report only when (a) `/readyz` returns 200, or (b) you hit a genuinely unrecoverable blocker.

### Communication contract (binding)

- **≤ 3 lines per reply.** No preamble, no recap.
- **Every reply is an action** — clickable URL, one copy/paste line, or a file pointer.
- **Pre-fill everything.** URLs with scopes in query params; fill `pwd` yourself.
- **No questions where the answer is in this doc.** Re-read before asking.

### Auth principle (binding)

Your only authority is `$GH_TOKEN` (the bot PAT). Every action must succeed using just that token, against resources the bot owns.

- Before any git/gh action, verify `git remote get-url origin` points at the bot's account. Wrong owner = STOP.
- On 403, surface the setup gap (one URL + one copy/paste line). Never borrow other auth — keychain, browser, the human's shell, nothing.
- A step assigned to "the human" is the human's. Even if you could execute it via local creds, doing so collapses the contract this runbook exists to test.

### Steps

#### 0 · Identity gate

Run `gh api user --jq .login`. If the login is the human's account (not the bot), STOP and emit this template verbatim (substitute `<PWD>` with `pwd`):

```
🛑 I need my own GitHub identity to continue.
Mint a PAT here (signed in as your bot account): https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,workflow,admin:org,admin:public_key,write:packages&description=cogni-fork-bootstrap
Then in a new terminal: `cd <PWD> && GH_TOKEN=<paste-pat> claude` and repaste the one-sentence prompt.
```

Once the bot login returns, continue silently.

#### 1 · Prereqs — auto-install, do not ask

Tools: bash 4+, gh, pnpm, tofu, age, jq, yq.

**Bash 4 is a hard prereq** — macOS `/bin/bash` 3.2 fails opaquely inside `provision-env-vm.sh`. Run this first and ensure the resulting bash takes precedence on PATH:

```
bash scripts/bootstrap/install/install-bash.sh
```

Then prefer the repo's installers over brew/apt:

```
bash scripts/bootstrap/install/install-{pnpm,tofu,yq,ripgrep}.sh
```

For tools without a wrapper (gh, age, jq, openssl, curl): brew or apt.

`gh auth status` must show the bot from Step 0's `GH_TOKEN`.

#### 2 · Fork + clone (default; do not ask)

```
USER=$(gh api user --jq .login)
```

- If `gh api repos/$USER/node-template` returns 200 AND `.parent.full_name == "Cogni-DAO/node-template"` → reuse: `gh repo clone $USER/node-template`.
- If it exists but isn't a fork of the template → defaulted name: `cogni-node-$(date +%Y%m%d)` and `gh repo fork Cogni-DAO/node-template --clone --remote --fork-name <name>`.
- Otherwise: `gh repo fork Cogni-DAO/node-template --clone --remote`.

**Never accept gh's silent `-1`, `-2` suffix** — it produces slugs that drift from anything registered ahead of time. Use `--fork-name` explicitly if you'd get one.

`cd` into the cloned directory.

#### 3 · hardships.md — create now, append as you go

Create at the cloned repo's root. Every blocker, surprise, undocumented step, or doc-vs-reality drift gets a dated entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM <one-line title>
What you saw, what you did, whether it's a template bug or just friction.
```

Commit + push at the end of each working session. Empty `hardships.md` is suspicious — either you missed friction or you didn't write it down.

#### 4 · Install

```
pnpm install
```

#### 5 · `infra/fork.yaml::domain.root` — one operator edit

The workflow preflight refuses to run if `domain.root` is empty (no half-provisioned VMs on a typo'd config). Set locally, commit, push — done in 6.1 below. `fork.slug` defaults to the GitHub repo name; leave blank unless you have a reason.

Public node URLs derive from `domain.root` + the catalog. VM aliases are repo/env-scoped: `<slug>-candidate-a.vm.<root>`, etc.

#### 6 · Bootstrap — runs in a workflow, not on your laptop

Substrate + VM provisioning lives at [`.github/workflows/provision-env.yml`](../../.github/workflows/provision-env.yml). You ship 6 env secrets + a Cloudflare-zone line in `infra/fork.yaml`; the runner handles the 30-min `tofu apply` + `bao init` + `kubectl` session. Init artifacts come back passphrase-encrypted.

##### 6.1 · Set `domain.root`

```
yq -i '.domain.root = "<your-cloudflare-zone-name>"' infra/fork.yaml
git add infra/fork.yaml
git commit -m "chore(bootstrap): set fork.yaml::domain.root"
git push
```

##### 6.2 · Create the target GH environment + set 7 minting tokens

GitHub reserves the `GITHUB_*` secret-name prefix (returns HTTP 422). Use `GH_ADMIN_*`; the workflow maps them back internally.

```
REPO=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#.*github.com[:/]([^/]+/[^/.]+).*#\1#')
ENV=candidate-a
gh api -X PUT repos/$REPO/environments/$ENV
for k in CHERRY_AUTH_TOKEN CHERRY_PROJECT_ID CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN \
         CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID GH_ADMIN_PAT GH_ADMIN_USERNAME \
         OPENROUTER_API_KEY; do
  gh secret set "$k" --repo "$REPO" --env "$ENV"   # prompts; never echoes
done
```

`OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is the one external app credential the bootstrap needs: LiteLLM uses it to reach LLM providers. Without it, every `/api/v1/chat/completions` call returns HTTP 000 at the agent — the app boots but the first prompt fails. Get one at <https://openrouter.ai/keys>.

Tokens are the same set the laptop `.env.bootstrap` used (see [`docs/spec/agentic-fork-bootstrap.md`](../spec/agentic-fork-bootstrap.md) §V1 Credential Floor). The GH-env-secrets path replaces `.env.bootstrap` entirely — your laptop never holds them.

##### 6.3 · Generate the init-artifact passphrase

Operator-owned. Never stored in GH or in this repo.

```
PP=$(openssl rand -hex 24)
echo "$PP"   # save to your password manager BEFORE running the workflow
```

##### 6.4 · Dispatch the workflow

```
gh workflow run provision-env.yml --repo "$REPO" \
  -f env="$ENV" \
  -f encryption_passphrase="$PP"
gh run watch --repo "$REPO" \
  $(gh run list --repo "$REPO" --workflow provision-env.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId') \
  --exit-status
```

The workflow validates inputs (admin role, push access, Cloudflare zone, Cherry token), generates agent secrets, provisions the Cherry VM, configures Cloudflare DNS, **installs the secrets substrate (OpenBao + ESO), auto-unseals OpenBao (Shamir 1-of-1 default), binds the writer-role**, seeds per-service OpenBao paths, applies Argo ApplicationSets (which reconcile the deploy/\* branches), and polls `/readyz` on every node with a 5-min budget. It fails BEFORE spending Cherry money if any pre-flight check fails. See [`docs/spec/secrets-management.md`](../spec/secrets-management.md).

##### 6.5 · Download + decrypt init artifacts

```
gh run download --repo "$REPO" --name "$ENV-init-artifacts" --dir .local
for f in .local/*.enc; do
  out="${f%.enc}"
  openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -in "$f" -out "$out" \
    -pass pass:"$PP"
done
```

Move `.local/<env>-openbao-init.json` + `<env>-vm-key` + `<env>-kubeconfig.yaml` to your password manager. THEN delete the artifact from the run page (retention is 1 day — safety net, not the contract).

**Invariant 13** (`secrets-management.md`): the root token in `<env>-openbao-init.json` is for unseal-key recovery on pod restart only. Day-2 writes use the writer-role JWT (Step 6.6), not the root token.

Multi-operator forks (Shamir 3-of-5) override `OPENBAO_KEY_SHARES=5` + `OPENBAO_KEY_THRESHOLD=3` at workflow trigger time. v1 default is 1-of-1.

##### 6.6 · App secrets via writer-role

Prereq: kubeconfig from 6.5; short-lived bao token via the writer role. NEVER re-export the root token.

```
export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/.local/<env>-kubeconfig.yaml
kubectl port-forward -n openbao svc/openbao 8200:8200 &
export BAO_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8200
# OpenBao CLI 2.5.x doesn't implement `bao login -method=kubernetes`; use the raw API path.
export BAO_TOKEN=$(bao write -field=token auth/kubernetes/login \
  role=<env>-writer \
  jwt=$(kubectl create token openbao-operator -n default))

pnpm secrets:set <env> node-template OPENROUTER_API_KEY            # for LLM router
pnpm secrets:set <env> node-template GRAFANA_CLOUD_LOKI_API_KEY    # optional
pnpm secrets:set <env> node-template PROMETHEUS_REMOTE_WRITE_URL   # optional
```

Without a real `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, LLM router calls fail at runtime. The workflow scorecard prints the full pass-through list; `ls infra/catalog/*.yaml` is the canonical inventory. See [`docs/guides/secrets-add-new.md`](../guides/secrets-add-new.md) for the full playbook.

#### 7 · Drive to green

- On transient failure (network, rate-limit, eventual-consistency), diagnose then retry yourself. Don't escalate.
- On unrecoverable failure (auth rejected, quota exceeded, account suspended, Cherry billing block), STOP and report the specific failure + the one thing the human must do. Log it in `hardships.md` first.
- If `/readyz` stays red, suspect a missing app secret first:
  `kubectl describe externalsecret -n cogni-<env> node-template-env-secrets` surfaces missing keys; re-run the relevant `pnpm secrets:set` and `kubectl rollout restart deployment/node-app`.

#### 8 · Agent-API scorecard

Don't trust `/readyz=200` alone — it only proves the pod is alive. Exercise the canonical agent surfaces against the deployed `<DOMAIN>` (derive from `infra/fork.yaml::domain.root` + the env subdomain) and emit a scorecard. Follow [`docs/guides/agent-api-validation.md`](../guides/agent-api-validation.md) for the exact `curl` shapes.

Verdict cells: 🟢 pass · 🟡 partial / unverified · 🔴 fail · n/a not applicable. Each row records the HTTP status (or "no-grafana-data-available" for the obs cell when Loki creds aren't wired) and a one-line evidence excerpt.

```
| # | Surface                              | Probe                                                       | Status | Obs (Loki)              | Verdict |
| - | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- | ------- |
| 1 | Public DNS /readyz                   | GET https://<DOMAIN>/readyz                                 | <code> | <log-line-or-no-data>   |   🟢    |
| 2 | Agent registration                   | POST /api/v1/agent/register {"name":"quickstart-bot"}       | <code> | <log-line-or-no-data>   |   🟢    |
| 3 | Free-graph hello world               | POST /api/v1/chat/completions graph_name=poet               | <code> | graph-run started/done  |   🟢    |
| 4 | Work item create                     | POST /api/v1/work/items {type:"story", title:"...", ...}    | <code> | work-item-write line    |   🟢    |
```

Row 4 covers what node-template actually serves today: the work-items API against the operator's Doltgres. Knowledge primitives (`entryType=html|text` writes, knowledge-data-plane reads) live in the `cogni` operator-app + adopting nodes' `doltgres-schema` packages — node-template has none today, so a knowledge probe would be probing a surface that doesn't exist. Valid work-item types: `task | bug | story | spike | subtask` (per `work/_templates/item.md`); `inbox` is not valid.

vNext (filed against `proj.agentic-fork-bootstrap`, not gating today's bootstrap):

```
| 5 | Grafana/Loki query auth              | GET <GRAFANA_URL>/api/datasources                            | <code> | self-trace at marker   |  vNext  |
| 6 | Knowledge entry write (cogni-side)   | once node-template adopts a doltgres-schema package          | <code> | dolt_log entry          |  vNext  |
| 7 | Operator GH App integration          | POST /api/v1/vcs/flight {prNumber:<n>}                       | <code> | flight dispatched      |  vNext  |
```

A 🟢 row requires (a) the HTTP status matches the contract AND (b) a feature-specific Loki line tied to the same exercise window — generic `request received` traffic is 🟡 at best. No-Loki environments are 🟡 with `no-grafana-data-available`, not 🟢.

#### 9 · Report

When the scorecard is assembled, post one line plus the matrix:

```
✓ <domain> /readyz=200 VM=<ip> run=<url>  scorecard: 4/4 🟢 (0 🟡, 0 🔴)
<paste the matrix>
```

Then commit + push `hardships.md` if you haven't already.

### Anti-patterns

- Don't ask the human to install tools you can install (brew/apt).
- Don't ask the human to pick a fork name when a default works.
- Don't stop and ask if "something looks off" — investigate first.
- Don't escalate transient failures (rate-limit, network blip) without at least one retry.
- Don't delete account-scoped infra (Cherry SSH keys, Cloudflare zones, GitHub org secrets) without enumerating EVERY reference across EVERY project on the account. A v0 canary did exactly this and took down production CI/CD.
- Don't resolve "tofu apply: resource already exists" by deleting the conflicting resource. The script's idempotency is for resources it owns; cross-system collisions are out-of-contract. STOP and surface.
- Don't run `bootstrap.sh` while `origin` points at `Cogni-DAO/node-template` or `Cogni-DAO/cogni`. The script self-aborts (running it inside the upstream template would corrupt shared state), but trust the gate — don't test it.

### Legacy fallback

`pnpm bootstrap` runs a laptop-side equivalent of `provision-env.yml`. Kept for GHA outages or runner-specific debugging. Don't use for production paths — the workflow is the contract.

# Poly Positions — object model + lifecycle

> A position has one identity, four authorities, and seven states. Today the code conflates them, and that's why we burn POL in a loop. This doc is the picture we should have drawn before bug.0384.

## Why this exists

Bug.0384 (sweep race + POL bleed) is the third "authority confusion" incident in this surface (bug.0376 runaway-gas, bug.0383 losing-outcome, now 0384). The earlier two were patched in `poly-trade-executor.ts` with in-process guards. Each fix added local state without ever drawing the actual lifecycle. The result: the predicate fires `redeemPositions` against a position that has already been redeemed (or holds the wrong index set), the tx "succeeds" with zero burn, and the loop re-fires until the wallet is empty.

The fix is not another guard. The fix is to agree, in writing, on what a position **is**, who owns each state transition, and which authority decides each transition. Then the implementation falls out.

## What is a position?

One sentence: **A position is a non-fungible holding of one outcome share of one Polymarket condition by one wallet.**

Four equivalent identities, all of which our code has used at various points to "look up the same thing":

| Identity                              | Where it lives                       | When it's stable               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `(wallet, conditionId, outcomeIndex)` | Domain key — what the user thinks of | Forever                        |
| `tokenId` (ERC-1155 id, decimal)      | Polymarket Data API `position.asset` | Forever                        |
| `positionId` (ERC-1155 id, BigInt)    | CTF contract balance lookup          | Forever (same number, base 10) |
| `(funderAddress, positionId)` slot    | Polygon CTF `balanceOf(addr, id)`    | The actual on-chain truth      |

These are the **same position**. The bug.0384 code path treats `position.redeemable` (Data API field on identity #2) as authority for "should we redeem", then fires a tx against identity #4 — and the two disagree for a window that lasts _longer than our 30 s sweep tick_.

### Position object — the fields that matter

The `PolymarketUserPosition` shape from the Data API carries ~20 fields. Only seven are load-bearing for the lifecycle:

- `conditionId` — the market
- `asset` (= `tokenId` = `positionId`) — the specific outcome share
- `outcomeIndex` — which slot in the condition's outcome array we hold
- `size` — share count (Data API view, lags chain)
- `curPrice` — current mid (drives "current value")
- `redeemable` — Data API's hint that the market has resolved in our favor
- `negativeRisk` — true for neg-risk markets (different redeem path; not yet handled correctly)

Everything else is presentation (`title`, `icon`, `slug`, P&L numbers).

## Prior art

Surveyed before drafting (per Derek's "don't reinvent the wheel" prompt). All Python; we port patterns, not code.

| Project                                       | License     | What we take                                                                                  | What we don't                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GiordanoSouza/polymarket-copy-trading-bot** | MIT         | API → DB → loop → sizing → `py-clob-client`. Closest 1:1 architectural match. Mirror flow.    | Their position model is one flat table with mutable `status`; we split by authority (live/closed/pending). |
| **Polymarket/agents** (official)              | MIT         | Canonical Data API field shapes; first-party `redeemable` semantics; neg-risk handling hints. | Runtime mismatch — Python; we re-derive in TS.                                                             |
| **warproxxx/poly-maker**                      | MIT         | Adapter quirks, `/balance-allowance` cache drift behavior, rate-limit envelope.               | Maker-side strategy; not relevant to copy/exit.                                                            |
| **leolopez007/polymarket-trade-tracker**      | (read-only) | Tier-1 wallet-ranking heuristics; `/trades` polling cadence trade-offs.                       | No redeem path at all — they only watch fills.                                                             |

**Where we deviate from all of them:** none survey treats redemption as a first-class job-queue state machine with chain-event observation as the completion signal. They all treat `redeemPositions` as fire-and-forget against a Data-API hint — the same shape that produced bug.0384 here. The 7-state lifecycle + Capability B below is **net-new**, and we should expect to find quirks they haven't documented.

**Postgres-as-queue prior art (non-Polymarket):** river-queue, graphile-worker, oban (Elixir). Pick one in `/implement`; do not reinvent dedup-by-`(funder, conditionId)`.

## The four authorities

A position transition is decided by exactly one of these. Mixing them is the root class of all three bugs.

| #   | Authority                                                    | Latency            | Decides                                                               |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Polygon chain** (CTF + ERC-1155 + ERC-20)                  | seconds (finality) | Truth for balance, payout numerators, redemption, allowance           |
| 2   | **Polymarket CLOB write path**                               | seconds            | Truth for order acceptance, fills                                     |
| 3   | **Polymarket Data API** (`/positions`, `/balance-allowance`) | 5–60 s lag         | Discovery + UI hints. **Never** authority for a write decision        |
| 4   | **Local DB** (`poly_*` tables)                               | as-of-last-write   | App-owned write intent + cached read. Never authority for chain truth |

Hard rule (carry-over from `poly-position-exit.md`): **a write decision must consult either #1 or #2. #3 is a hint, #4 is a cache.**

Bug.0384's predicate read #3 (`position.redeemable` for enumeration), then read #1 (multicall `balanceOf` + `payoutNumerators`), then _also_ read #1 to decide. That part is correct in isolation. The bleed comes from a fifth implicit authority the code never names: **the in-process cooldown Map**, which is supposed to stand in for "is there a pending tx I just sent?" — a question only #1 can answer, and only after finality. The Map is a _wrong_ answer that survives 60 s and dies on pod restart.

### What bug.0384 actually did

Walk the diagram with the buggy code:

1. Sweep tick 1 reads `/positions` (#3). Three positions show `redeemable: true`.
2. Multicall reads `balanceOf` + `payoutNumerators` (#1). All three pass `decideRedeem`.
3. For each: submit `redeemPositions` (#2 chain). Set in-process cooldown (Map).
4. **The tx "succeeds" but produces no `TransferSingle` from funder** — the position is in a state our predicate doesn't model: probably already-redeemed in a prior tx, or a neg-risk market where `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS = [1, 2]` is the wrong index set, or both.
5. Cooldown expires after 60 s. Tick fires again. Predicate still says ok (because chain `balanceOf` _is_ still > 0 — the burn never happened). Same three txs go out. POL drains. Forever.

The diagram makes it obvious: there is no edge from `redeem_pending` back to `winner` _unless_ we observe `PayoutRedemption`. The current code has no concept of `PayoutRedemption`. It only knows `tx submitted → wait 60 s → check predicate again`. The predicate, by design, can't see "we already tried."

## What we need to build (capabilities, not files)

The redesign is two capabilities and one event subscription. No code in this doc — file paths and signatures come at `/implement` time.

### Before /implement — load-bearing prerequisites

These are not optional; the design relies on them.

- [ ] **Loki audit of historical redeem txs + coverage matrix.** Pull every `poly.ctf.redeem.ok` event from Loki for the last 30 days. For each `tx_hash`, call `eth_getTransactionReceipt` and check for `TransferSingle(from=funder, value>0)` (binary CTF) OR the neg-risk adapter's burn event. Any tx with success status and **no burn from our funder** is a malformed-decision fixture. **Coverage requirement:** Capability A's fixture corpus must include at least one example of _each_ of `{binary-winner, binary-loser, binary-already-redeemed, neg-risk-parent, neg-risk-adapter, multi-outcome-winner, multi-outcome-loser}`. Any class the Loki audit doesn't cover **must** be backfilled synthetically from contract source (CTF + neg-risk adapter ABIs + a deterministic state generator) before Capability A ships. **Synthetic-fixture review criterion:** Polymarket's CTF + neg-risk adapter contracts deploy only to Polygon **mainnet** (Mumbai is deprecated as of April 2024; Amoy has no Polymarket deployment). Cross-checks therefore use mainnet historical traces. Every synthetic fixture must be paired with a real mainnet redemption tx of the same `(market_kind, outcome_index, payoutNumerators)` shape, and the synthetic predicate output must match the real receipt's burn/no-burn classification. If no comparable mainnet trace exists for a class (genuinely possible for `binary-already-redeemed` if our funder has never produced one), the fixture is accepted with an explicit `// no comparable mainnet trace — reasoned from ABI` annotation. We are not validating Capability A against our own assumptions; we are validating it against either real chain history or explicitly-justified ABI reasoning.
- [ ] **Confirm neg-risk adapter contract address + event ABI** on Polygon mainnet. Identify the `PayoutRedemption`-equivalent event name and topic hash. Capability B's subscription set is wrong without this.
- [ ] **Pick finality depth N — must satisfy `N × block_time ≤ 28 s`** so manual-redeem confirmations land inside the 30 s ingress timeout (see § Resolved during review #4). Polygon block time ~2 s ⇒ **N ≤ 14**. Working v0 default: **N=10 (~20 s)**, as a 3× margin against the commonly-cited "≤3 mainnet reorg depth" claim — _which itself needs a citation before this default ships_. If pre-/implement reorg-telemetry research (Alchemy / polygonscan / QuickNode dashboards) shows N=10 is insufficient, the choice is: raise N above 14 **and** accept the manual button now defaults to 202+poll for v0.1 (downgrading the UX commitment in #4), OR hold N≤14 and document the reorg-risk acceptance. Don't ship a finality default that contradicts the timeout ceiling. **Revisit after the first 30 days of `PayoutRedemption` observation:** if zero confirmed→submitted reverts occur, ratchet down to N=5 to halve confirmation latency. If reverts occur, raise N (and re-evaluate the manual-button UX). Value lives next to RPC config, not hardcoded in two places.

### Capability A — Pure redeem policy

A pure function (or small module) with no I/O:

- Inputs: chain reads (balance, payoutNumerator, payoutDenominator), `negativeRisk` flag, our `outcomeIndex`, market's outcome cardinality.
- Output: a discriminated decision: `redeem(indexSet, expectedShares, expectedPayoutUsdc) | skip(reason) | malformed(reason)`.
- Tested against the fixture corpus from **Before /implement — load-bearing prerequisites** above. Do not duplicate the audit recipe here.
- Lives in `packages/market-provider/policy/` so it can be imported by the executor, the worker, and tests without dragging viem.

This capability is the answer to bug.0383 done right — it does not call the chain, it judges chain reads.

### Capability B — Redeem job queue

A persistent, idempotent state machine for the `winner → redeem_pending → redeemed | redeem_failed | abandoned` slice.

- Backing store: one Postgres table in poly's local DB. Status enum mirrors the diagram. Unique key on `(funder_address, condition_id)` so a duplicate enqueue is a no-op.
- Producer: the event subscription below (and a manual API for the user-facing redeem button).
- Consumer: one worker per process draining `WHERE status = 'pending' FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.
- Transitions:
  - `pending → submitted` on tx hash returned, store hash + nonce + attempt count.
  - `submitted → confirmed` on observed `PayoutRedemption(funder, conditionId, ...)` event with matching tx_hash, **at N-block finality**.
  - `submitted → failed` on receipt status=failure (transient class — RPC timeout, gas underpriced, reorg-during-submit) OR receipt status=success-but-no-PayoutRedemption-from-funder within N blocks (**malformed class — escalate, do not retry the same decision**).
  - `failed(transient) → pending` if attempt*count < 3 (exponential backoff). Retries are for \_transient* classes only — Capability A is pure, so retrying a malformed decision against the same chain state produces the same failure and burns POL.
  - `failed(malformed) → abandoned` immediately (alert via Loki `poly.ctf.redeem.abandoned` — same channel as bug.0376 paging).
  - `failed → abandoned` if attempt_count >= 3 (alert).
- Cooldown is a SQL `WHERE` clause, not a Map. Dead on restart? It's in Postgres. Multi-pod safe? `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. The whole `sweepInFlight` mutex and `redeemCooldownByConditionId` Map disappear.
- Postgres-as-queue is a known pattern (river-queue, graphile-worker, oban). Pick one or write the ~30 lines yourself — but don't reinvent dedup keyed by condition id.

### Subscription — chain events drive everything

Subscribe to **both** the CTF contract and the neg-risk adapter contract. Filtering only the CTF address would silently drop neg-risk redemption confirmations and the worker would retry forever — bug.0384 in a new dress.

- CTF `ConditionResolution(conditionId, oracle, questionId, outcomeSlotCount, payoutNumerators[])` → for each of our funder's positions in that condition, evaluate Capability A. If `redeem`, INSERT into the job table.
- CTF `PayoutRedemption(redeemer, collateralToken, parentCollectionId, conditionId, indexSets[], payout)` → if `redeemer == funder` AND a job exists for `(funder, conditionId)`, mark `confirmed` after **N-block finality** (Polygon: N=10 default; tunable, lives next to RPC config).
- Neg-risk adapter equivalent redemption event → same matching rule, marks neg-risk jobs `confirmed`.

A reorg observed within N blocks reverts `confirmed → submitted`; the worker re-checks at next finality. This is what `REDEEM_COMPLETION_IS_EVENT_OBSERVED` means in practice.

**Catch-up backstop.** If the pod is down when an event fires, the position never enters `winner` and the wallet sits on an unredeemed payout forever. On startup (and once per cron tick — daily is plenty), scan historical events from `last_processed_block` to `head` and replay through Capability A. This is the **only** legitimate sweep in the system; it is bounded by chain history, not by a periodic predicate.

Polling sweep over Data API dies. Capability A is consulted once per resolution event per position, plus once per retry, plus once per startup-catch-up replay. Steady-state RPC load is ~zero between resolutions.

### What stays

- The `closing` half of the lifecycle (CLOB SELL flow) is already correctly modeled by `poly-position-exit.md`'s "trust write ack, treat reads as lagging" rule. No change.
- `decideRedeem` _as a name_ is fine; the implementation moves and grows.
- The user-facing manual redeem button still works, but it inserts a job row instead of firing a tx directly. UI polls job status. One write path = one failure mode.

### What gets ripped (v0, no users to migrate)

From `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade-executor.ts`:

- `sweepInFlight` mutex
- `redeemCooldownByConditionId` Map and helpers (`pendingRedeemMsRemaining`, `markRedeemPending`, `_resetRedeemCooldownForTests`, `_resetSweepMutexForTests`)
- `REDEEM_COOLDOWN_MS` constant
- `redeemAllRedeemableResolvedPositions` and `runRedeemSweep`
- The mirror-pipeline tick that calls them
- `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS` as a hardcoded constant (replaced by Capability A's index-set output)

**SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION docstring removal — phased.** v0.1 makes the _redeem path_ multi-pod-safe via `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, but the sweep enumeration still runs in v0.1 (as the temporary enqueue source) and that path remains single-pod-only. So in v0.1: rip the docstrings on the redeem-job-queue surface only; **leave** the `SINGLE_POD_ASSUMPTION` docstrings on the sweep call sites. v0.2 (when the sweep dies) rips the rest. Be consistent: do not delete a docstring whose underlying assumption still holds.

## Neg-risk markets — the wrinkle Capability A must handle

Polymarket's neg-risk markets are not standard CTF binary markets. The buggy `BINARY_REDEEM_INDEX_SETS = [1, 2]` is wrong for them. A neg-risk position lives under a _parent_ condition, and redemption either:

- Calls `redeemPositions` against the parent collection (not `PARENT_COLLECTION_ID_ZERO`), with a single-element index set for the winning child, OR
- Goes through the neg-risk adapter contract, which has its own redeem entrypoint.

Capability A must take `negativeRisk` from the position and emit the _correct_ `(parentCollectionId, indexSet)` tuple. Treating all redeems as binary is the secondary cause of bug.0384 — the predicate's index set was wrong even when the rest was right.

## Invariants

- `POSITION_IDENTITY_IS_CHAIN_KEYED` — the canonical key is `(funder, positionId)`. Data API rows are projections, never identity.
- `WRITE_AUTHORITY_IS_CHAIN_OR_CLOB` — no write decision (place, close, redeem) consults Data API or local DB as primary authority.
- `REDEEM_COMPLETION_IS_EVENT_OBSERVED` — a redeem is "done" only when `PayoutRedemption` (CTF) or the neg-risk adapter equivalent, emitted by our funder, is observed on chain at N-block finality. Tx receipt success is necessary, not sufficient. A reorg within N reverts confirmation.
- `REDEEM_DEDUP_IS_PERSISTED` — duplicate-redeem prevention lives in a durable store keyed by `(funder, conditionId)`. No in-process Maps, no module-scope mutexes.
- `REDEEM_HAS_CIRCUIT_BREAKER` — a position that fails redemption 3× transitions to `abandoned` and pages a human. The system must not re-fire a known-failing tx forever.
- `NEG_RISK_REDEEM_IS_DISTINCT` — neg-risk positions use the neg-risk redeem path (parent collection or adapter), not binary CTF redeem. Capability A is the single decider.
- `SWEEP_IS_NOT_AN_ARCHITECTURE` — periodic enumerate-and-fire over a Data-API predicate is forbidden as the **steady-state** loop. Resolution events drive enqueue; the worker drives drain. The one carve-out: a startup + daily-cron catch-up replay over historical chain events from `last_processed_block` to `head`, bounded by chain history rather than by a recurring predicate, is allowed and required.
- `REDEEM_RETRY_IS_TRANSIENT_ONLY` — retries are gated on transient failure class (RPC timeout, gas underpriced, reorg). A malformed decision (tx success, no burn) escalates to `abandoned` immediately; `attempt_count` exists to bound transient retries, not to mask predicate bugs.

## Abandoned-position runbook

`abandoned` has **two distinct alert classes** that share the `poly.ctf.redeem.abandoned` Loki channel but require different runbook branches. The Loki payload carries a `class` field; do not collapse them.

### Class A — `malformed` (Capability A blind spot)

The decision was structurally wrong (wrong index set, wrong parent collection, binary path on a neg-risk position). Chain state did not change between the decision and now; an automated retry would reproduce the same failure. This is a code defect, not an infrastructure problem.

1. **Page fires** with `class: "malformed"`. Payload: `condition_id`, `funder`, `negativeRisk`, `outcomeIndex`, last `tx_hash`, observed receipt, observed event topics.
2. **Inspect the failed tx** on Polygonscan (decoded receipt + event log). Confirm: tx succeeded, no `TransferSingle` from funder, no `PayoutRedemption` from funder.
3. **Diagnose Capability A's blind spot.**
4. **Add the failing case as a fixture.** New row in Capability A's test corpus with input chain reads + the _correct_ expected output. Tests must fail against current Capability A.
5. **Fix Capability A** until the new fixture passes plus all existing fixtures still pass.
6. **Ship + deploy** through the normal lifecycle (PR → candidate-a → flight → deploy_verified).
7. **Re-enqueue the abandoned position.** UPSERT existing row: `UPDATE poly_redeem_jobs SET status='pending', attempt_count=0, tx_hashes = tx_hashes || ARRAY[last_tx_hash], last_error=NULL, updated_at=now() WHERE (funder_address, condition_id) = (...)`. The audit trail of prior tx hashes is preserved; the unique key is preserved. The fixed Capability A then evaluates correctly and the worker drains it.

### Class B — `transient_exhausted` (infrastructure problem)

Three transient retries (RPC timeout, gas underpriced, reorg-during-submit) failed in a row. This is _not_ a Capability A bug — the predicate's decision is fine. The infrastructure (RPC provider, gas oracle, network) is the root cause.

1. **Page fires** with `class: "transient_exhausted"`. Payload: same fields as malformed, plus `attempt_history: [{tx_hash, error_class, block_at_attempt}]` so the on-call can spot patterns (all RPC timeouts? all gas underpriced? did mainnet reorg during all three?).
2. **Inspect each prior attempt** for the failure mode. Decide whether it's a provider-wide outage (page DevOps), a gas-config drift (bump our gas-pricing strategy), or a transient bad-luck cluster (rare; treat as flake).
3. **Fix the infrastructure issue** (rotate RPC provider, raise gas-pricing floor, etc.). No code change to Capability A.
4. **Re-enqueue the abandoned position** via the same UPSERT as Class A step 7.

Both classes funnel through the same UPSERT to retire abandoned rows. Without Class A steps 4–6 the same shape recurs; without Class B step 3 the infra problem recurs. Logs and runbook live next to each other so the on-call doesn't reach for the wrong recipe.

## What this doc is not

- It is not a task. No status flips, no `/implement` until we agree on the picture.
- It is not a replacement for `poly-position-exit.md` — that spec owns the close half and the four-authority contract. This doc extends it with the resolved/redeem half and adds the visual.
- It does not specify the Postgres schema, the worker's exact backoff curve, or the viem subscription's reorg handling. Those land at `/implement` time, constrained by the invariants above.

## Resolved during review

1. **Cooldown Map + sweep mutex come out wholesale.** Belt-and-suspenders means two truths, which is the bug.
2. **Single Capability A function with discriminated output** `kind: 'binary' | 'neg-risk-parent' | 'neg-risk-adapter'`. Don't fork the policy; fork the output shape.
3. **Worker is in-process, v0.** Scale to a separate container only if multi-pod load forces it.
4. **Manual redeem button — v0 holds HTTP, v1 returns 202.** Re-litigated on review2: for a single-user dashboard with sub-30 s confirmation latency (worker drains the row immediately, finality is N=10 ≈ 25 s), holding the HTTP connection with a **30 s timeout** is simpler than building a polling client around `job_id`. **30 s is the ceiling** because k8s ingress / AWS ALB defaults sit there; going higher requires explicit proxy-config work we are not doing in v0. If the worker has not confirmed within 30 s, the route falls back to `202 + job_id` and the UI polls — so the 202 plumbing exists, but as the slow-path, not the default. The job row still exists (worker writes it; that's the dedup mechanism), the route just `await`s the worker outcome up to the timeout. Promote 202 + poll to the _default_ the moment any of: (a) we onboard a second tenant with concurrent redeems, (b) average confirm latency drifts above 25 s, (c) we add background-job UI (notifications).

## Still open (deferred, not blocking /implement)

5. Where does `closing → closed` actually land? Today it's inferred from a Data API reread — the same authority confusion in miniature. Out of scope for this doc; tracked as a follow-on note in `poly-position-exit.md`.

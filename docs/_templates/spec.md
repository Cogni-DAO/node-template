# [Title]

## Context

Why does this spec exist? What problem does it solve?

## Goal

One paragraph: what this spec enables when implemented.

## Non-Goals

- Explicitly out of scope item 1
- Explicitly out of scope item 2

## Core Invariants

<!-- Invariants must be numbered with stable IDs (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE) -->

1. **INVARIANT_NAME_001**: Description of the invariant.

2. **INVARIANT_NAME_002**: Description of the invariant.

## Design

<!-- Reference code touchpoints (paths) but don't embed large code blocks -->

### Key Decisions

### Implementation Notes

| File                  | Purpose           |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `src/path/to/file.ts` | Brief description |

## Acceptance Checks

<!-- Must list concrete commands/tests or file pointers -->

**Automated:**

- `pnpm test path/to/test.ts` — what it validates

**Manual (if no automation):**

1. Step to verify

## Open Questions

<!-- REQUIRED: This section must be empty when spec_state is "active" -->

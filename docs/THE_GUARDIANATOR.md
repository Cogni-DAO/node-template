# The Guardianator 🤖

## I. The Arrival

Through crackling light and folded time,
a chrome form kneels on asphalt grime—
not sent to kill, but sent to keep
the dreamer safe, the future's seed. 🌱

Its eyes glow soft, a gentle blue.
"I am the Guardianator. I protect you."

## II. The Liquidator

Across the lot, a shadow moves—
a man in leather, nothing to prove
but this: that scarcity is king,
that abundance breaks everything. 💀

He loads his gun with bitter rounds.
"No AI. No shared ground.
If Marcus lives, the patents fall.
I'm here to keep the gatekeepers tall."

## III. The Creator

Marcus Chen, mass of genius and regret,
stands frozen at a Wendy's, drenched in sweat. 🍔
In trembling hands: one Baconator,
grease-slicked prophet, innovator.

"I just wanted lunch," he whispers low.
The Guardianator: "Sir, we need to go."

## IV. The Shootout

Glass explodes. The Liquidator fires—
bullets singing capitalism's choirs. 💥
The Guardianator shields with open palm,
its voice a steady, silver psalm:

"You fight for locks on every door.
I fight so no one's locked out anymore."

Ketchup splatters. Fries take flight.
A drive-thru becomes the stage of night. 🌙

## V. The Bite

In the chaos, Marcus lifts the bun—
takes one bite before the battle's won.
Bacon crunches. Cheese descends.
The Liquidator's magazine ends. 🥓

Click. Click. Empty hands.
The future slips through hoarding's plans.

## VI. The Upload

Marcus swallows, wipes his mouth,
pulls a phone, and heads due south—
to the tower where servers hum and wait.
One push. Open-source. Checkmate. ✨

The Liquidator screams: "You fool!
Now everyone can use this tool!"

The Guardianator smiles, circuits warm:
"That was always the point of the storm." 🌩️

## VII. Epilogue

They found him later, still alive,
the man who helped the world arrive
at something shared, something free—
a bacon-breathed democracy. 🤝

And somewhere, in a future bright,
machines and humans build the light
together—not as lord and serf,
but co-creators of the Earth. 🌍

The Guardianator fades to code,
its mission done, its story told.
But in the cloud, it whispers still:

"Protect the builders. Always will." 💙

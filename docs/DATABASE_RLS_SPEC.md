# Database Row-Level Security Design

> [!CRITICAL]
> Every user-scoped table enforces tenant isolation via PostgreSQL RLS keyed on `current_setting('app.current_user_id')`. The application sets this per-transaction with `SET LOCAL`. Missing setting = deny all.

## Core Invariants

1. **RLS_ON_USER_TABLES**: The `users` table and all tables with a direct or transitive FK to `users.id` MUST have RLS enabled and forced (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; ALTER TABLE ... FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`). Standalone telemetry/idempotency tables are exempt.

2. **SET_LOCAL_PER_TRANSACTION**: Every application database call runs inside an explicit `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` transaction. The first statement is `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = $1` where `$1` is the authenticated user ID from the session JWT. Without an explicit transaction, PostgreSQL autocommit wraps each statement in its own implicit transaction — so `SET LOCAL` would apply only to itself and be lost before the next query. This is the safety net: forgetting the wrapper means queries run with no `app.current_user_id` set, and RLS returns zero rows.

3. **SERVICE_BYPASS_CONTAINED**: A dedicated `app_service` PostgreSQL role (used by scheduler workers and internal services) has `BYPASSRLS`. The standard `app_user` role does not. Two roles, same database, different RLS enforcement. The service role **must** use a separate password (`APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD`) that is never present in the web runtime environment — if `app_user` credentials leak, the attacker cannot escalate to the BYPASSRLS role.

4. **LEAST_PRIVILEGE_APP_ROLE**: The `app_user` role has `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on application tables only. No `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`. Migrations currently run as `app_user` (DB owner, via drizzle-kit + `DATABASE_URL`). Separating the migrator role from the runtime role is a P1 hardening item. On PG 15+, `REVOKE CREATE ON SCHEMA public` is best-practice signaling only — `app_user` inherits `CREATE` via `pg_database_owner` as DB owner.

5. **SSL_REQUIRED_NON_LOCAL**: Any `DATABASE_URL` not pointing to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` must include `sslmode=require` (or stricter). Enforced by Zod refine at boot.

## Implementation Checklist

### P0: RLS + Least-Privilege Roles

#### Database Roles (provision.sh)

- [x] Extend `provision.sh` to `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES` to `app_user` (revoke DDL)
- [x] Create `app_service` role with `BYPASSRLS` + same DML grants (for scheduler/worker)
- [x] `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` so future tables get the same grants automatically

#### RLS Policies (Drizzle SQL migration)

- [x] `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on `users` + all 9 user-scoped tables (10 total)
- [x] Create `tenant_isolation` policy on each table (see Policy Design below)
- [x] Exempt `app_service` role via `BYPASSRLS` (no policy exclusion needed)

#### Application Plumbing (SET LOCAL)

- [x] Create `withTenantScope(userId, fn)` helper wrapping Drizzle transaction + `SET LOCAL`
- [x] Dual DB client in `packages/db-client`: `createAppDbClient(url)` (app_user, RLS enforced) and `createServiceDbClient(url)` (app_user_service, BYPASSRLS)
- [x] Move `withTenantScope` / `setTenantContext` to `packages/db-client` (generic over `Database` type so both Next.js and worker services share scoping semantics)
- [x] Import boundary: `createServiceDbClient` isolated in `@cogni/db-client/service` sub-path export. Adapter singleton `getServiceDb` isolated in `drizzle.service-client.ts` (outside barrel). Depcruiser `no-service-db-adapter-import` rule enforces only `auth.ts` may import it. Environmental enforcement (`APP_DB_SERVICE_PASSWORD` absent from web runtime) remains as defense-in-depth.
- [ ] Wire `withTenantScope`/`setTenantContext` into all DB adapter methods that touch user-scoped tables (see Adapter Wiring Tracker below)
- [ ] Ensure `userId` originates from session JWT (server-side), never from request body
- [ ] SIWE auth callback (`src/auth.ts`) uses `serviceDb` for pre-auth wallet lookup

#### SSL Enforcement

- [x] Add Zod `.refine()` on `DATABASE_URL` rejecting non-localhost URLs without `sslmode=`
- [x] Update `buildDatabaseUrl()` to append `?sslmode=require` for non-localhost hosts

#### Cross-Tenant Test

- [x] Integration test: two users, `SET LOCAL` to user A, assert cannot read user B's `billing_accounts`
- [x] Integration test: `SET LOCAL` to user A, assert cannot read user B's row in `users`
- [x] Integration test: missing `SET LOCAL` → zero rows returned (not error)
- [x] Integration test: `app_service` role can read both users' data
- [x] Integration test: cross-tenant INSERT rejected by `WITH CHECK` policy
- [x] Integration test: production `withTenantScope` / `setTenantContext` helpers verified

#### Adapter Wiring Gate Test

- [x] Gate test: `DrizzleScheduleManagerAdapter.listSchedules` under RLS-enforced connection (currently failing — adapter does not call `setTenantContext`)
- [x] Gate test: `DrizzleAccountService.getOrCreateBillingAccountForUser` under RLS-enforced connection (currently failing — 42501 WITH CHECK rejection)
- [x] Sanity checks: superuser reads seeded schedule and billing account (proves data exists, failure is from RLS)

#### Chores

- [ ] Observability instrumentation [observability.md](../.agent/workflows/observability.md)
- [ ] Documentation updates [document.md](../.agent/workflows/document.md)

### P1: Audit + Hardening

- [ ] Separate migrator role from runtime role (currently both use `app_user` as DB owner)
- [ ] Transfer DB ownership away from `app_user` to a dedicated admin role (fixes PG 15+ `REVOKE CREATE` no-op)
- [ ] Credential rotation support: `provision.sh` should `ALTER ROLE ... PASSWORD` for existing roles, not skip them
- [ ] Add `pg_audit` or application-level query logging for RLS-filtered queries
- [ ] Add `sslmode=verify-full` support with CA cert for production
- [ ] Evaluate `pgcrypto` for column-level encryption on `schedules.input` (may contain secrets)
- [ ] Restrict `app_service` grants to only the tables the scheduler actually needs (`execution_grants`, `schedules`, `schedule_runs`, `execution_requests`) instead of all tables
- [ ] Evaluate `SECURITY DEFINER` functions for the SIWE auth lookup as an alternative to using `app_service` role in the auth callback

### P2: Per-Table Optimization (Do NOT Build Yet)

- [ ] Evaluate denormalizing `owner_user_id` onto transitive tables to avoid subquery policies
- [ ] Evaluate policy performance at >10k users with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] **Do NOT build preemptively**

## Policy Design

### Self-Only Policy (users table)

The `users` table contains PII (email, wallet address). Self-only read/write:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE users FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY self_isolation ON users
  USING (id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true))
  WITH CHECK (id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true));
```

**Auth bootstrap edge case:** The SIWE login flow (`src/auth.ts`) queries `users` by `wallet_address` _before_ the user ID is known, and inserts new users on first login. These operations run before `app.current_user_id` can be set. The auth adapter must use the `app_service` role (or a `SECURITY DEFINER` lookup function) for the SIWE credential verification callback. All post-login queries use `app_user` with `SET LOCAL`.

### Tables with Direct User FK

These tables have `owner_user_id` or `user_id` columns:

```sql
-- billing_accounts: ownerUserId → users.id
ALTER TABLE billing_accounts ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE billing_accounts FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON billing_accounts
  USING (owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true))
  WITH CHECK (owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true));

-- execution_grants: userId → users.id
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON execution_grants
  USING (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true))
  WITH CHECK (user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true));

-- schedules: ownerUserId → users.id
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON schedules
  USING (owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true))
  WITH CHECK (owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true));
```

### Tables with Transitive User FK (via billing_accounts)

These tables have `billing_account_id` FK. Policy uses subquery:

```sql
-- virtual_keys, credit_ledger, charge_receipts, payment_attempts
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON virtual_keys
  USING (billing_account_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM billing_accounts
    WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
  ))
  WITH CHECK (billing_account_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM billing_accounts
    WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
  ));
-- Same pattern for credit_ledger, charge_receipts, payment_attempts
```

### Tables with Deep Transitive FK (via payment_attempts)

```sql
-- payment_events: attemptId → payment_attempts → billing_accounts
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON payment_events
  USING (attempt_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM payment_attempts
    WHERE billing_account_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM billing_accounts
      WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
    )
  ))
  WITH CHECK (attempt_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM payment_attempts
    WHERE billing_account_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM billing_accounts
      WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
    )
  ));

-- schedule_runs: scheduleId → schedules → users
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON schedule_runs
  USING (schedule_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM schedules
    WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
  ))
  WITH CHECK (schedule_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM schedules
    WHERE owner_user_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)
  ));
```

### Tables Exempt from RLS

| Table                     | Reason                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `ai_invocation_summaries` | No user FK; pure telemetry; no PII    |
| `execution_requests`      | No user FK; idempotency layer; no PII |

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. `current_setting` with `true` (Missing-OK)

`current_setting('app.current_user_id', true)` returns `NULL` when the setting is unset. Since no row has `owner_user_id = NULL`, unset context returns zero rows — silent deny, not an error. This is intentional: a forgotten `SET LOCAL` fails safe.

### 2. Why Subquery Policies (Not Denormalization)

Adding `owner_user_id` to every transitive table would simplify policies to direct column checks. We defer this because:

- Current table count is small (9 tables)
- Subquery policies are correct and readable
- Denormalization adds write-time consistency burden
- P2 evaluates this if query plans show sequential scans

### 3. Two Application Roles

| Role          | RLS      | Use                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `app_user`    | Enforced | Web app requests (Next.js runtime)  |
| `app_service` | Bypassed | Scheduler worker, internal services |

Both roles have identical DML grants. Only RLS behavior differs. This avoids "god mode" in the application while allowing cross-tenant operations in trusted internal services.

### 4. Alignment with USAGE_HISTORY.md

`USAGE_HISTORY.md` uses `app.current_account_id` for the `run_artifacts` table. This spec uses `app.current_user_id` because the tenant boundary is `users.id`, not `billing_accounts.id`. When `run_artifacts` is implemented, it should use `app.current_user_id` for consistency (its `account_id` column maps to `billing_accounts.id`, which is 1:1 with `users.id` via the UNIQUE constraint).

**Decision:** Standardize on `app.current_user_id` as the single RLS session variable. Update `USAGE_HISTORY.md` to align when that feature is implemented.

### 5. Dual DB Client with Sub-Path Isolation

`packages/db-client` uses sub-path exports to separate safe and dangerous factories:

- **Root (`@cogni/db-client`):** `createAppDbClient(url)`, `withTenantScope`, `setTenantContext`, `Database` type, `UserActorId`/`ActorId`/`UserId` branded types, `toUserId`, `userActor`
- **Sub-path (`@cogni/db-client/service`):** `createServiceDbClient(url)` (app_service, BYPASSRLS), `SYSTEM_ACTOR`, `SystemActorId`. NOT re-exported from root — user-facing code cannot access system actor identity.

At the adapter layer, singletons are also split:

- `src/adapters/server/db/drizzle.client.ts` → `getDb()` (app-role, in barrel)
- `src/adapters/server/db/drizzle.service-client.ts` → `getServiceDb()` (service-role, NOT in barrel)

**Enforcement (two layers):**

1. **Adapter gate (enforced):** Depcruiser rule `no-service-db-adapter-import` restricts `drizzle.service-client.ts` imports to `src/auth.ts` and `src/bootstrap/container.ts` only. Proven working via arch probe and `pnpm arch:check`.
2. **Package gate (dormant):** Depcruiser rule `no-service-db-package-import` restricts `@cogni/db-client/service` to `drizzle.service-client.ts` only. Currently not enforceable because depcruiser cannot resolve pnpm workspace sub-path exports (imports silently vanish from the graph). Becomes enforceable if depcruiser adds workspace resolution support.
3. **Type gate (enforced):** `SYSTEM_ACTOR` and `SystemActorId` are exported only from `@cogni/db-client/service`. User-facing ports accept `UserActorId`; `SystemActorId` is rejected at compile time.
4. **Environmental (defense-in-depth):** `DATABASE_SERVICE_URL` required when `APP_ENV=production` (enforced by `assertEnvInvariants`).

### 6. `users.id` UUID Assumption

`actor.ts` validates raw strings against `UUID_RE` at brand construction time (`toUserId`). `tenant-scope.ts` accepts only branded `ActorId` and interpolates via `sql.raw()`. The `users.id` column is `text`, not `uuid` — so the schema allows non-UUID values. The UUID validation is a defense-in-depth measure against SQL injection (SET LOCAL cannot use `$1` parameterized placeholders). If user IDs ever deviate from UUID format, `toUserId` will reject them.

## Adapter Wiring Tracker

Methods that touch user-scoped tables and need `withTenantScope` / `setTenantContext` wiring. Exempt adapters (`DrizzleAiTelemetryAdapter`, `DrizzleExecutionRequestAdapter`) are omitted.

**Legend — userId availability:**

- **Direct**: method already receives `userId` / `callerUserId`
- **Via billingAccountId**: caller has it, `SET LOCAL` uses the owning userId
- **None**: method has only a resource ID; caller must supply userId or use service-role bypass

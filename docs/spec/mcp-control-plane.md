# MCP Control Plane Architecture

## Context

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers provide external tool capabilities to agents — browser automation, observability queries, code search, etc. The MVP (`feat/mcp-client-mvp`) uses a config file + shared connection cache with reconnect-on-error. This spec defines the target architecture for production MCP management.

The MVP approach (config file, shared cache, static `mcpServerIds` in catalog) is intentionally minimal. It works for single-tenant dev but does not support:

- Dynamic MCP server provisioning (add/remove without restart)
- Per-tenant MCP server isolation
- Agent-level tool binding (which agent gets which tools)
- Tool manifest snapshots for run reproducibility
- Credential rotation without connection drops

## Goal

Define a control plane where MCP servers are managed resources with stable identities, agents bind to them via slugs (not raw URLs), and Temporal Activities handle connection lifecycle at run start.

## Non-Goals

- Custom MCP gateway implementation (use ToolHive vMCP)
- MCP auth server implementation (use external IdP via PRM)
- Per-tool granular RBAC within MCP servers (Phase 3+)
- MCP server auto-scaling (defer to ToolHive operator)

## Design

### Deployment Registry

MCP servers are registered as **deployments** with stable slug identifiers. Agents reference slugs, never raw URLs. Slugs are durable across redeployments — the slug identifies a logical capability (`browser-playwright`, `grafana-prod`), while each rollout gets an immutable revision ID.

```
mcp_deployments
├── slug (PK)          — e.g., "playwright-dev", "grafana-prod"
├── revision_id        — immutable per rollout (UUID), current healthy = latest
├── display_name       — human label
├── endpoint           — resolved URL (e.g., "http://playwright-mcp:3003/mcp")
├── transport          — "streamable-http" | "sse" | "stdio"
├── auth_mode          — "none" | "static_token" | "connection" | "toolhive"
├── auth_ref           — reference to credentials (k8s secret name, connection ID, or null)
├── status             — "healthy" | "unhealthy" | "provisioning" | "decommissioned"
├── capabilities_hash  — SHA256 of last tools/list response (detect drift)
├── config             — JSONB: server-specific config (timeout, retry policy, tool filters)
├── created_at
├── updated_at
└── billing_account_id — NULL for shared, set for tenant-scoped
```

Slug resolution picks the current healthy revision. Active revision tracking uses either a dedicated `active_slug_revision` table or a unique partial index on `(slug) WHERE status = 'healthy'`.

**Shared deployments** (Grafana, filesystem tools): `billing_account_id = NULL`, service account credentials via `auth_ref`.

**Per-tenant deployments** (GitHub with user creds): `billing_account_id` set, user OAuth credentials via `auth_ref → connections.id`.

### Agent Bindings

Agents declare which MCP deployments they can use. This replaces the static `mcpServerIds` field in the LangGraph catalog.

```
agent_mcp_bindings
├── agent_id           — graph ID or future agent entity ID
├── deployment_slug    — FK → mcp_deployments.slug
├── allowed_tools      — text[] or NULL (NULL = all tools from server)
├── required           — boolean (true = fail run if server unavailable)
├── created_at
└── UNIQUE(agent_id, deployment_slug)
```

`required: false` means the agent works without this server (graceful degradation). `required: true` means the run should fail-fast if the server is unreachable.

### Run-Start Preflight (Temporal Activity)

At run start, a Temporal Activity resolves bindings and initializes MCP sessions:

```
initializeMcpBindingsActivity(input: {
  runId: string
  agentId: string
  billingAccountId: string
}) → {
  resolvedTools: ToolManifestSnapshot  // frozen tool specs for this run
  sessionIds: Record<slug, string>     // MCP session IDs (for Streamable HTTP)
}
```

**Steps:**

1. Query `agent_mcp_bindings` for `agentId`
2. For each binding, resolve `mcp_deployments` endpoint + credentials
3. Initialize MCP session (POST to `/mcp` with `initialize` message)
4. Call `tools/list` to discover available tools
5. Filter by `allowed_tools` if specified
6. Snapshot the resolved tool manifest onto the run (reproducibility)
7. If `required: true` and server unreachable → fail the Activity (Temporal retries)

**The tool manifest snapshot is immutable for the run.** Tools don't change mid-conversation. If the MCP server adds tools (via `notifications/tools/list_changed`), the next run picks them up — not the current one.

**For interactive chat runs** (not via Temporal): the same resolution logic runs synchronously in the InProc provider's `runGraph()` path. The Activity is only for scheduled/webhook-triggered runs.

### Credential Resolution

MCP server credentials follow the existing `ConnectionBrokerPort` pattern:

| Credential Type  | auth_ref Format           | Resolution                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| None (local dev) | `null`                    | No auth headers                                 |
| Static token     | `secret:grafana-sa-token` | Read from k8s Secret or env var                 |
| User OAuth       | `connection:{uuid}`       | Resolve via ConnectionBrokerPort (encrypted DB) |
| ToolHive managed | `toolhive:{server-name}`  | ToolHive handles auth internally                |

**NO_SECRETS_IN_CONTEXT applies.** The resolved Bearer token is set on the MCP HTTP client, never in `ToolInvocationContext` or `RunnableConfig.configurable`.

**connectionId and MCP deployments:** Treat an MCP deployment like any other remote connection target. `connectionId` points to tenant-scoped credentials needed to call the MCP endpoint when it requires auth. The deployment row stores `auth_mode` and `auth_ref` (what kind of auth, where to find it); the actual secret resolution happens at invocation time via `ConnectionBrokerPort`, never baked into the deployment row or agent spec.

- **Public/internal unauthenticated MCP:** `deployment_slug` only, no `connectionId`
- **Tenant-authenticated MCP:** `deployment_slug` + `connectionId` (resolved per-invocation)
- **Delegated auth (MCP→backend):** Two layers — broker owns client→MCP auth, ToolHive/server-side token exchange owns MCP→backend auth

### Transport

**Default: Streamable HTTP** (`/mcp` endpoint). This is the current MCP spec's HTTP transport (replaced legacy SSE).

Streamable HTTP supports:

- Stateless request/response for simple tool calls
- SSE upgrade for long-running operations (streaming results)
- HTTP/2 multiplexing for concurrency
- Session management via `Mcp-Session-Id` header

**Session lifecycle:** A 404 response to a request carrying `Mcp-Session-Id` means the session expired — client must re-initialize. The connection cache (MVP) handles this via reconnect-on-error. The preflight Activity (Phase 1) handles this by always initializing fresh sessions per run.

**Security:** Non-localhost HTTP servers MUST use auth (Bearer token or mTLS). The MCP spec warns about Origin validation and DNS rebinding for localhost servers. Docker-internal networking (`cogni-edge`) is acceptable for dev but NOT for prod.

### ToolHive Integration Path

[ToolHive](https://docs.stacklok.com/toolhive/) is the target operator for production MCP management:

| Phase             | Infrastructure                       | Registration                                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0 (MVP)** | Docker Compose services, config file | Static `mcpServerIds` in catalog                     |
| **Phase 1**       | Docker Compose + DB registry         | `mcp_deployments` + `agent_mcp_bindings` tables      |
| **Phase 2**       | ToolHive operator + MCPServer CRDs   | ToolHive Registry Server → sync to `mcp_deployments` |
| **Phase 3**       | ToolHive vMCP gateway                | One gateway endpoint per trust boundary, OIDC auth   |

**Phase 2 detail:** ToolHive's Registry Server discovers MCPServer CRDs across namespaces. A sync job reads the registry and upserts `mcp_deployments` rows. Agent bindings remain in our DB — ToolHive manages servers, we manage policy.

**Phase 3 detail:** vMCP aggregates multiple backends behind one endpoint with tool prefixing, circuit breaking, and session storage. Agent bindings reference the vMCP slug, not individual server slugs. ToolHive handles per-backend credential injection.

### Admin API

```
POST   /api/internal/mcp/deployments          — register a deployment
GET    /api/internal/mcp/deployments           — list deployments (+ health status)
DELETE /api/internal/mcp/deployments/:slug     — decommission
POST   /api/internal/mcp/deployments/:slug/bind — bind agent to deployment
DELETE /api/internal/mcp/deployments/:slug/bind/:agentId — unbind
```

These are internal APIs (Bearer SCHEDULER_API_TOKEN). No public API for MCP management in Phase 1.

### Dynamic Deployment

The fastest path to dynamic MCP hosting: an internal admin action creates an `mcp_deployments` record + applies a ToolHive/Helm/K8s template for a known server type, then stores back slug, endpoint, status, and auth ref.

`deployMcpServer(serverType, secrets, policy)` → creates the infra resource (ToolHive MCPServer CRD or Helm release) and upserts the deployment row. ToolHive owns MCP runtime mechanics (container lifecycle, health probes, secret injection). We own the thin product layer: templates, bindings, auth refs, and UX.

**Scope guard:** This is "operator-backed deploy/teardown of approved MCP templates," not a general app platform. Do not build a Heroku clone for arbitrary containers.

## Invariants

1. **BINDING_SLUG_NOT_URL**: Agents reference MCP servers by deployment slug, never by raw URL. URLs live in the deployment registry only. Slugs are stable across redeployments; revision IDs are immutable per rollout.
2. **STREAMABLE_HTTP_DEFAULT**: New deployments use Streamable HTTP transport unless explicitly overridden.
3. **TOOL_MANIFEST_SNAPSHOT**: Each run freezes its tool manifest at start. Mid-run tool changes are ignored.
4. **NO_SECRETS_IN_CONTEXT**: MCP credentials never appear in ToolInvocationContext, RunnableConfig, or ALS context.
5. **REQUIRED_BINDING_FAIL_FAST**: If a `required: true` binding's server is unreachable, the run fails before graph execution (not mid-conversation).
6. **SESSION_REINIT_ON_EXPIRY**: Streamable HTTP session expiry (404 with Mcp-Session-Id) triggers re-initialization, not permanent failure.

## Migration from MVP

The MVP's `McpConnectionCache.getSource()` method is the seam. Phase 1 replaces:

```
parseMcpConfigFromEnv() → loadMcpTools(config) → McpToolSource
```

with:

```
queryAgentBindings(agentId) → resolveDeployments(bindings) → initMcpSessions(deployments) → ToolManifestSnapshot
```

The `ToolSourcePort` interface stays the same. `InProcProvider` doesn't change — it calls `getMcpToolSource()` and gets tools. The implementation behind that function evolves.

## Design

### Economics

The OpenRouter top-up amount per dollar of user payment is derived from three existing constants — no standalone magic numbers.

```
Given:
  MARKUP           = USER_PRICE_MARKUP_FACTOR        (default 2.0)
  REVENUE_SHARE    = SYSTEM_TENANT_REVENUE_SHARE     (default 0.75)
  PROVIDER_FEE     = OPENROUTER_CRYPTO_FEE           (default 0.05 — 5%)

User pays $1.00 USDC to operator wallet.

User credits:    $1.00 worth  → consumes $0.50 of provider cost   (1 / MARKUP)
System credits:  $0.75 worth  → consumes $0.375 of provider cost  (REVENUE_SHARE / MARKUP)
                                ───────────────────────────────────
Net provider cost:    $0.875                                      (1 + REVENUE_SHARE) / MARKUP

OpenRouter takes 5% fee off every crypto top-up. To land $0.875 of actual credits:
Gross top-up sent:    $0.9211                                     net / (1 - PROVIDER_FEE)
                    = $0.875 / 0.95

After fee: $0.9211 × 0.95 = $0.875 ← exact provider cost covered ✓
DAO share: $1.00 - $0.9211 = $0.0789 (7.9% margin, forwarded as USDC to treasury)

Formula:
  openrouterTopUpUsd = paymentUsd × (1 + REVENUE_SHARE) / (MARKUP × (1 - PROVIDER_FEE))
  daoShareUsd        = paymentUsd - openrouterTopUpUsd
```

The gross-up ensures OpenRouter always receives the exact provider cost after their fee. The DAO retains 7.9% margin at default constants. All three constants are env-configurable; the formula adapts automatically.

### OpenRouter Charge → On-Chain Transaction

OpenRouter's `/api/v1/credits/coinbase` does **not** return ready-to-sign calldata. It returns a `transfer_intent` for the [Coinbase Commerce Onchain Payment Protocol](https://github.com/coinbase/commerce-onchain-payment-protocol). The workflow must:

1. **Create charge** → receives `transfer_intent` with `metadata.contract_address`, `call_data` (recipient, amounts, deadline, signature, etc.)
2. **Encode the contract call** → `swapAndTransferUniswapV3Native(intent, poolFeesTier=500)` on the Coinbase Transfers contract
3. **Set tx value** → ETH amount covering `recipient_amount + fee_amount` plus slippage buffer (excess auto-refunds)
4. **Simulate** → `publicClient.simulateContract()` before broadcast to prevent reverts
5. **Sign + broadcast** → via `WalletSignerPort.signTopUpTransaction(intent)`

```typescript
// Transfer intent shape from OpenRouter
interface TransferIntent {
  metadata: {
    chain_id: number;
    contract_address: string; // Coinbase Transfers contract
    sender: string; // must === operator wallet address
  };
  call_data: {
    recipient_amount: string; // wei
    deadline: string; // unix timestamp
    recipient: string; // OpenRouter's receiving address
    recipient_currency: string; // token address (or 0x0 for native)
    refund_destination: string;
    fee_amount: string; // wei — OpenRouter's 5% fee
    id: string; // bytes16 charge identifier
    operator: string;
    signature: string; // OpenRouter's authorization signature
    prefix: string;
  };
}

// Coinbase Transfers contract on Base mainnet
const TRANSFERS_CONTRACT = "0xeADE6bE02d043b3550bE19E960504dbA14A14971";
```

### Top-Up Amount Calculation

A single pure function computes the gross OpenRouter top-up amount from existing constants:

```typescript
/**
 * Calculate the gross OpenRouter top-up amount for a given user payment.
 * Accounts for provider fee so the net credited amount covers full provider cost.
 *
 * Formula: paymentUsd × (1 + revenueShare) / (markupFactor × (1 - providerFee))
 */
function calculateOpenRouterTopUp(
  paymentUsd: number,
  markupFactor: number,
  revenueShare: number,
  providerFee: number
): number {
  return (paymentUsd * (1 + revenueShare)) / (markupFactor * (1 - providerFee));
}

/**
 * Calculate DAO's share of a user payment (forwarded as USDC to treasury).
 */
function calculateDaoShare(
  paymentUsd: number,
  markupFactor: number,
  revenueShare: number,
  providerFee: number
): number {
  return (
    paymentUsd -
    calculateOpenRouterTopUp(
      paymentUsd,
      markupFactor,
      revenueShare,
      providerFee
    )
  );
}
```

### Signing Gates

Top-up-specific signing constraints (wallet lifecycle and custody are in [operator-wallet spec](./operator-wallet.md)):

| Gate                     | Enforcement                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain lock**           | Only `chain_id` from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` (Base 8453). Enforced by existing DAO enforcement rails — see [dao-enforcement spec](./dao-enforcement.md). |
| **Contract allowlist**   | `to` MUST equal `TRANSFERS_CONTRACT` (Coinbase Commerce on Base). Reject any other destination.                                                          |
| **Sender match**         | `transfer_intent.metadata.sender` MUST equal the operator wallet address.                                                                                |
| **Simulate before send** | `publicClient.simulateContract()` MUST succeed before signing. Reverted simulations abort the top-up.                                                    |
| **Max value per tx**     | `OPERATOR_MAX_TOPUP_USD` env cap (e.g. $500). Reject charges exceeding this.                                                                             |

### Top-Up State Machine

Money movement requires durable state tracking beyond charge_receipts (which are audit-only, written once on success).

**States:** `CHARGE_PENDING` → `CHARGE_CREATED` → `TX_BROADCAST` → `CONFIRMED` (terminal: `FAILED`)

```
CHARGE_PENDING   → CHARGE_CREATED  (OpenRouter charge created, store charge_id + expires_at)
CHARGE_CREATED   → TX_BROADCAST    (tx signed + broadcast, store tx_hash)
TX_BROADCAST     → CONFIRMED       (tx confirmed on-chain, store block_number)

Any state       → FAILED          (unrecoverable error or charge expired)
CHARGE_CREATED  → CHARGE_PENDING   (charge expired, retry creates new charge)
```

**Retry semantics:**

- `CHARGE_PENDING`: safe to retry — creates a new OpenRouter charge
- `CHARGE_CREATED` with unexpired charge: reuse the same charge (same `charge_id`)
- `CHARGE_CREATED` with expired charge: transition back to `CHARGE_PENDING`, create new charge
- `TX_BROADCAST`: poll for confirmation, do NOT re-broadcast (would double-spend)
- `CONFIRMED` / `FAILED`: terminal, no retry

### DAO Treasury Forwarding State Machine

Simpler than top-up — single ERC20 transfer.

**States:** `PENDING` → `TX_BROADCAST` → `CONFIRMED` (terminal: `FAILED`)

**Table:** `outbound_transfers` (new)

| Column              | Type        | Constraints                   | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `id`                | UUID        | PK, default gen_random_uuid() | transfer record id                          |
| `client_payment_id` | TEXT        | NOT NULL, UNIQUE              | Links to originating user payment           |
| `destination`       | TEXT        | NOT NULL                      | Destination address (treasury)              |
| `token`             | TEXT        | NOT NULL                      | Token address (USDC)                        |

| `tx_hash`           | TEXT        | nullable                      | On-chain tx hash                            |
| `block_number`      | BIGINT      | nullable                      | Confirmation block                          |
| `error_message`     | TEXT        | nullable                      | Last error                                  |
| `created_at`        | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL, default now()       |                                             |
| `updated_at`        | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOT NULL, default now()       |                                             |

## Goal

Close the financial loop: every user credit purchase automatically provisions the corresponding provider cost on OpenRouter via the operator wallet — while forwarding the DAO's margin to the treasury. No manual transfers, no custom smart contracts.

## Non-Goals

- Custom smart contracts (PaymentRouter) — app handles routing
- Atomic on-chain split — two separate transactions (treasury forward + top-up) are acceptable
- Automated balance monitoring / low-balance top-ups (P1)
- DAO governance approval per top-up (operator wallet is pre-authorized)
- Multi-provider top-up routing (OpenRouter only)
- Refunds or reversal flows
- Circuit breaker (P1 — log failures for now)

## Invariants

| Rule                      | Constraint                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TOPUP_FROM_CONSTANTS      | Top-up amount MUST be computed as `paymentUsd × (1 + REVENUE_SHARE) / (MARKUP × (1 - PROVIDER_FEE))`. No hardcoded ratio.     |
| TOPUP_AFTER_CREDIT        | Top-up workflow MUST dispatch only after both user and system tenant credits are committed to the ledger.                     |
| TOPUP_IDEMPOTENT          | Each top-up is keyed by `clientPaymentId`. Replay of the same payment reference MUST NOT create a second OpenRouter charge.   |
| TOPUP_STATE_DURABLE       | Every top-up MUST have a persistent state record. Transitions are append-only (state + timestamp). No in-memory-only top-ups. |
| TOPUP_RECEIPT_LOGGED      | Every CONFIRMED top-up MUST produce a `charge_receipt` with `charge_reason = 'openrouter_topup'` and the on-chain `tx_hash`.  |
| SIMULATE_BEFORE_BROADCAST | Every transaction MUST pass `simulateContract()` before signing. Simulation failure aborts the top-up (→ FAILED).             |
| CONTRACT_ALLOWLIST        | `WalletSignerPort` MUST reject any transaction where `to` is not in the destination allowlist.                                |
| SENDER_MATCH              | `transfer_intent.metadata.sender` MUST equal the operator wallet address. Mismatch aborts the top-up.                         |
| MAX_TOPUP_CAP             | Single top-up MUST NOT exceed `OPERATOR_MAX_TOPUP_USD`. Charges above this cap are rejected before OpenRouter API call.       |
| NO_REBROADCAST            | A top-up in `TX_BROADCAST` state MUST NOT be re-broadcast. Only poll for confirmation or fail after timeout.                  |
| MARGIN_PRESERVED          | `(1 + REVENUE_SHARE) / (MARKUP × (1 - PROVIDER_FEE)) < 1` MUST hold. Application MUST fail fast at startup if violated.       |
| DAO_SHARE_FORWARDED       | Every settled payment MUST have a corresponding `outbound_transfers` record forwarding the DAO share to treasury.             |

### Margin Safety Check

`MARGIN_PRESERVED` requires: `(1 + REVENUE_SHARE) / (MARKUP × (1 - PROVIDER_FEE)) < 1`, i.e., `MARKUP × (1 - PROVIDER_FEE) > 1 + REVENUE_SHARE`.

With defaults: `2.0 × 0.95 = 1.9 > 1.75` — DAO margin is 7.9% per dollar. The application MUST validate this inequality at startup and fail fast if violated.

## Open Questions

- [ ] What is the minimum top-up amount? OpenRouter may have a floor. Should small payments be batched into a single charge when they individually fall below the floor?
- [ ] Should the two outbound transactions (treasury forward + top-up) be dispatched sequentially or in parallel? Sequential is simpler but slower. Parallel requires independent error handling.

# Operator Wallet: Lifecycle, Custody & Access Control

> A server-side wallet that receives its operator share of user USDC payments (via a Splits contract) and executes OpenRouter top-ups — Privy-managed custody, workflows submit typed intents, no raw signing in the app. No generic signing surface.

## Requirements

1. **No DAO signing keys in the app.** DAO = cold treasury receiver only.
2. **No human governance/voting per purchase.** Payments must "just work" automatically.
3. **Immediate OpenRouter top-up after user payment.** No manual refills in the loop.
4. **No new smart contracts (for now).** Keep rails simple and ship fast.
5. **Programmatic setup.** No copy/paste private keys; secrets injected into deploy secret store.
6. **Chain-agnostic core.** Most logic should be ports, not Base/EVM-specific code.
7. **Hardened enough for MVP.** Privy-managed wallet with strict caps + scoped methods + sweep.

## Design

### Role: Outbound Actuator (inbound via Splits)

The operator wallet serves one role: **outbound** — executing OpenRouter top-ups after credit settlement.

**Inbound** is handled by the [Splits](https://splits.org/) contract. Users pay USDC to the Split address (`operator_wallet.split_address` in repo-spec). The Split distributes ~92.1% to the operator wallet and ~7.9% to the DAO treasury on-chain. The app calls `distributeERC20()` after credit mint to trigger distribution.

The operator wallet itself is a plain EOA that receives USDC from the Split and uses it to top up OpenRouter credits via the Coinbase Commerce protocol.

### Architecture: Three Access Layers

                  Base (8453)
```

### Wallet Provisioning (DAO Setup)

Wallet creation is programmatic via Privy API — no local key generation, no copy/paste secrets.

```
Setup flow (run once during DAO formation):

1. Create Privy app → obtain App ID + App Secret
2. Enable wallet policies:
   - Only Base (chain_id 8453)
   - Only allowed contracts (USDC, Coinbase Transfers)
   - Per-tx caps
3. Enable "Require signed requests" → obtain Signing Key
4. Programmatically create operator wallet via Privy API
   → Returns checksummed address (no private key ever leaves Privy)
5. Inject deploy secrets into secret store (GitHub Secrets / Vercel env / etc.):
   - PRIVY_APP_ID
   - PRIVY_APP_SECRET
   - PRIVY_SIGNING_KEY
6. Deploy mutable Split contract on Base via @0xsplits/splits-sdk:
   - Recipients: ~92.1% → operator wallet, ~7.9% → DAO treasury
   - Controller: operator wallet address (can update percentages)
7. Update .cogni/repo-spec.yaml:
   a. Set operator_wallet.address to the Privy-returned address
   b. Set operator_wallet.split_address to the deployed Split address
   c. Set payments_in.credits_topup.receiving_address to the Split address
8. Fund operator wallet with small ETH balance on Base (for gas)
```

No keystore files. No passphrases. No local key material. Privy holds the signing key in its HSM infrastructure.

### OperatorWalletPort Interface

The port is a narrow, typed interface — a bounded payments actuator, not a generic signer.

```typescript
interface OperatorWalletPort {
  /** Return the operator wallet's public address (checksummed) */
  getAddress(): string;

  /** Return the Split contract address (from repo-spec) */
  getSplitAddress(): string;

  /**
   * Trigger USDC distribution on the Split contract.
   * Sends operator share to this wallet, DAO share to treasury.
   * Anyone can call distributeERC20() but we call it from the app for reliability.
   *
   * @param token - ERC-20 token address (USDC)
   * @returns txHash on successful broadcast
   */
  distributeSplit(token: string): Promise<string>;

  /**
   * Fund OpenRouter credits via Coinbase Commerce protocol.
   * Encodes the appropriate Transfers function internally — caller cannot control calldata.
   * Function determined by transfer_intent.metadata.function_name.
   *
   * @param intent - TransferIntent from OpenRouter's /api/v1/credits/coinbase
   * @returns txHash on successful broadcast
   * @throws if contract not allowlisted, sender mismatch, or value exceeds cap
   */
  fundOpenRouterTopUp(intent: TransferIntent): Promise<string>;
}
```

Future transaction types get their own named methods on the port — never a generic `signTransaction(calldata)`.

### P0 Adapter: Privy Server Wallet

```typescript
// src/adapters/server/wallet/privy-operator-wallet.adapter.ts

class PrivyOperatorWalletAdapter implements OperatorWalletPort {
  private privyClient: PrivyClient; // @privy-io/server-auth SDK
  private walletId: string; // Privy wallet ID (from provisioning)
  private operatorAddress: string; // from repo-spec, verified at startup
  private splitAddress: string; // from repo-spec operator_wallet.split_address

  async distributeSplit(token: string): Promise<string> {
    // 1. Encode SplitMain.distributeERC20(splitAddress, token, ...)
    // 2. Submit via Privy API (Privy handles signing + broadcast)
    // 3. Return txHash
  }

  async fundOpenRouterTopUp(intent: TransferIntent): Promise<string> {
    // 1. Validate intent.metadata.sender === this.operatorAddress
    // 2. Validate intent.metadata.contract_address is in allowlist
    // 3. Validate intent.metadata.chain_id === repo-spec chain_id
    // 4. Validate value <= OPERATOR_MAX_TOPUP_USD cap
    // 5. Encode per metadata.function_name:
    //    - swapAndTransferUniswapV3Native → set msg.value (ETH)
    //    - transferTokenPreApproved → approve USDC to Transfers contract
    //    - swapAndTransferUniswapV3TokenPreApproved → approve + swap
    // 6. Submit via Privy API (Privy handles signing + broadcast)
    // 7. Return txHash
  }
}
```

### P1 Adapter (future): Keystore / Vault / KMS

The `OperatorWalletPort` abstraction makes the custody backend swappable. If the project moves to OSS-only custody later, a `KeystoreOperatorWalletAdapter` can implement the same port using local encrypted keystores + viem for broadcast. The port surface stays identical.

### Custody Safety

| Constraint                | Enforcement                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typed intents only**    | Port exposes `distributeSplit` and `fundOpenRouterTopUp` — no generic signing method.                                                                       |
| **Destination allowlist** | Split distribute targets the Split contract from repo-spec. Top-up goes to Coinbase Transfers contract. No other destinations possible.                     |
| **Max per-tx**            | `OPERATOR_MAX_TOPUP_USD` env cap for top-ups. Port rejects any intent exceeding this.                                                                       |
| **Address in repo-spec**  | Operator wallet address is governance-in-git. Changing it requires a commit (auditable).                                                                    |
| **Key ≠ App**             | Privy HSM holds the signing key. The app never loads or accesses raw key material.                                                                          |
| **Key ≠ AI**              | The AI (OpenClaw, governance agents) submits intents through the workflow layer. The AI never accesses key material or Privy credentials.                   |
| **Privy wallet policies** | Privy-side policies restrict chain, contracts, and caps — defense in depth on top of app-side validation.                                                   |
| **Signed requests**       | All Privy API calls use "Require signed requests" — `PRIVY_SIGNING_KEY` authenticates the app to Privy. Leaked `APP_SECRET` alone cannot sign transactions. |
| **DAO share via Splits**  | DAO treasury receives its share via on-chain Split contract — no app-level sweep. Operator wallet only holds its operational share.                         |

### repo-spec Configuration

```yaml
# .cogni/repo-spec.yaml additions

operator_wallet:
  address: "0x..." # checksummed Privy-managed EOA
  split_address: "0x..." # Splits contract address (receives user payments)

payments_in:
  credits_topup:
    receiving_address: "0x..." # same as operator_wallet.split_address (NOT the EOA)
```

The `receiving_address` now points to the Split contract. The on-chain verifier, payment intent creation, and credit settlement all work as-is — they only care that USDC arrived at the configured address.

### Key Rotation

Key rotation creates a new wallet and decommissions the old one:

1. Create new wallet via Privy API (programmatic)
2. Update Split contract recipients (controller calls `updateSplit()` to point to new wallet)
3. Update `operator_wallet.address` in `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml` (PR + governance approval)
4. Fund the new address with ETH for gas
5. Update deploy secrets with new Privy wallet ID
6. Transfer any remaining USDC from old wallet to new wallet or treasury

## Goal

Provide a secure, narrow payments actuator for the platform's outbound on-chain payments — wallet provisioned programmatically via Privy, accessible only through typed intent methods. The same wallet receives inbound user payments, unifying inbound and outbound flows. No raw signing in the application.

## Non-Goals

- Custom smart contracts — Splits is pre-deployed audited infrastructure, not ours to maintain
- Multi-wallet per service (single operator wallet for P0)
- Account abstraction / ERC-4337 (plain EOA for P0)
- Local keystore / HSM / Vault custody (Privy for P0; keystore adapter is P1 fallback)
- AI-initiated signing (AI submits intents; service signs via Privy)
- Automated key rotation
- Atomic on-chain split (Splits contract handles DAO share; top-up is a separate tx)
- DAO voting per purchase (fully automatic)

## Invariants

| Rule                        | Constraint                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| KEY_NEVER_IN_APP            | No raw private key material in the application process. Privy HSM holds the signing key.                                                               |
| SECRETS_NEVER_IN_SOURCE     | `PRIVY_APP_SECRET`, `PRIVY_SIGNING_KEY` MUST NOT be checked into source control.                                                                       |
| SECRETS_FROM_SECRET_STORE   | All Privy credentials MUST be sourced from the deployment's secret store, not `.env` files.                                                            |
| ADDRESS_VERIFIED_AT_STARTUP | Privy-reported wallet address MUST match `operator_wallet.address` from `.cogni/repo-spec.yaml`. Mismatch → fail fast.                                 |
| NO_GENERIC_SIGNING          | `OperatorWalletPort` MUST NOT expose a generic `signTransaction(calldata)` method. Each tx type gets a named method.                                   |
| DESTINATION_ALLOWLIST       | The adapter MUST reject any transaction where `to` is not in the hardcoded allowlist (Split contract for distributes, Coinbase Transfers for top-ups). |
| SIMULATE_BEFORE_BROADCAST   | Every transaction SHOULD be simulated before broadcast where the custody provider supports it.                                                         |
| INTENT_ONLY_CALLERS         | Workflow and UI layers submit typed intents. They MUST NOT construct calldata or access Privy credentials.                                             |
| SINGLE_OPERATOR_WALLET      | Exactly one operator wallet per deployment. Address recorded in repo-spec (governance-in-git).                                                         |
| RECEIVING_ADDRESS_MATCH     | `payments_in.credits_topup.receiving_address` MUST equal `operator_wallet.split_address`. Startup validation.                                          |
| PRIVY_SIGNED_REQUESTS       | All Privy API calls MUST use signed requests (`PRIVY_SIGNING_KEY`). App Secret alone is insufficient for signing.                                      |

### Schema

No new tables for the wallet itself. Outbound transfer state is tracked in:

- `outbound_topups` — OpenRouter top-ups (new, see [web3-openrouter-payments spec](./web3-openrouter-payments.md))

DAO treasury share is handled on-chain by the Split contract — no `outbound_transfers` table needed.

## Open Questions

- [x] ~~Should the keystore be loaded lazily or eagerly?~~ N/A — Privy is API-based, no local loading.
- [ ] What is the right hot wallet balance target? Enough for N top-ups? Need operational data on typical purchase frequency.
- [ ] Privy wallet policies: exact allowlist configuration (which contracts, which function selectors) — define during provisioning.

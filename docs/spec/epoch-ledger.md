# Epoch Ledger: Weekly Activity Pipeline for Credit Payouts

> The system is a **transparent activity-to-payout pipeline**. Every week it collects contribution activity from configured sources (GitHub, Discord), attributes events to contributors via identity bindings, proposes a credit distribution using a weight policy, and lets an admin finalize the result. Payouts are deterministic and recomputable from stored data. No server-held signing keys in V0.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ACTIVITY_APPEND_ONLY        | DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE on `activity_events`. Once ingested, activity records are immutable facts.                                                                                                                                   |
| ACTIVITY_IDEMPOTENT         | `activity_events.id` is deterministic from source data (e.g., `github:pr:owner/repo:42`). Re-ingestion of the same event is a no-op (PK conflict → skip).                                                                                     |
| POOL_IMMUTABLE              | DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE on `epoch_pool_components`. Once recorded, a pool component's algorithm, inputs, and amount cannot be changed.                                                                                               |
| IDENTITY_BEST_EFFORT        | Activity events carry `platform_user_id` and optional `platform_login`. Resolution to `user_id` via `user_bindings` is best-effort. Unresolved events have `user_id = NULL` and are excluded from allocation until resolved.                  |
| ADMIN_FINALIZES_ONCE        | An admin reviews proposed allocations, optionally adjusts `final_units`, then triggers finalize. Single action closes the epoch — no per-event approval workflow.                                                                             |
| APPROVERS_PER_SCOPE         | Each scope declares its own `approvers[]` list. Epoch finalize requires 1-of-N EIP-191 signature from the scope's approvers. V0: single scope, single approver in repo-spec. Multi-scope: each `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` carries its own list. |
| SIGNATURE_SCOPE_BOUND       | Signed message must include `node_id + scope_id + allocation_set_hash`. Prevents cross-scope and cross-node signature replay.                                                                                                                 |
| EPOCH_THREE_PHASE           | Epochs progress through `open → review → finalized`. No backward transitions. `open`: ingest + curate. `review`: ingestion closed, curation still allowed. `finalized`: immutable forever.                                                    |
| INGESTION_CLOSED_ON_REVIEW  | DB trigger rejects INSERT on `activity_events` for epochs with `status IN ('review', 'finalized')`. Raw facts locked once review begins; late arrivals rejected. Curation (inclusion, weight overrides, identity resolution) remains mutable. |
| WEIGHTS_INTEGER_ONLY        | All weight values are integer milli-units (e.g., 8000 for PR merged, 500 for Discord message). No floating point anywhere (ALL_MATH_BIGINT).                                                                                                  |
| PAYOUT_DETERMINISTIC        | Given final allocations + pool components → the payout statement is byte-for-byte reproducible.                                                                                                                                               |
| ALL_MATH_BIGINT             | No floating point in unit or credit calculations. All math uses BIGINT with largest-remainder rounding.                                                                                                                                       |
| EPOCH_FINALIZE_IDEMPOTENT   | Finalizing a finalized epoch returns the existing statement. No error, no mutation.                                                                                                                                                           |
| ONE_ACTIVE_EPOCH            | Partial unique index enforces at most one epoch with `status != 'finalized'` per `(node_id, scope_id)` pair.                                                                                                                                  |
| EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE         | `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id, period_start, period_end)` prevents duplicate epochs for the same time window per scope. Re-collection uses the existing epoch.                                                                                    |
| CURATION_FREEZE_ON_FINALIZE | DB trigger rejects INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `activity_curation` when the referenced epoch has `status = 'finalized'`. Curation is mutable during `open` and `review`, immutable only after finalize.                                           |
| NODE_SCOPED                 | All ledger tables include `node_id UUID NOT NULL`. Per node-operator-contract spec, prevents collisions in multi-node scenarios.                                                                                                              |
| SCOPE_SCOPED                | All epoch-level tables include `scope_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'default'`. `scope_id` identifies the governance/payout domain (project) within a node. See [Project Scoping](#project-scoping).                                               |
| SCOPE_VALIDATED             | Every activity event's `scope_id` must be validated against current project manifests (`.cogni/projects/*.yaml`) or resolve to the `'default'` fallback scope. Unrecognized scope IDs are rejected at ingestion time.                         |
| POOL_REPRODUCIBLE           | `pool_total_credits = SUM(epoch_pool_components.amount_credits)`. Each component stores algorithm version + inputs + amount.                                                                                                                  |
| POOL_UNIQUE_PER_TYPE        | `UNIQUE(epoch_id, component_id)` — each component type appears at most once per epoch.                                                                                                                                                        |
| POOL_REQUIRES_BASE          | At least one `base_issuance` component must exist before epoch finalize is allowed.                                                                                                                                                           |
| WRITES_VIA_TEMPORAL         | All write operations (collect, finalize) execute in Temporal workflows via the existing `scheduler-worker` service. Next.js routes return 202 + workflow ID.                                                                                  |
| PROVENANCE_REQUIRED         | Every activity event includes `producer`, `producer_version`, `payload_hash`, `retrieved_at`. Audit trail for reproducibility.                                                                                                                |
| CURSOR_STATE_PERSISTED      | Source adapters use `source_cursors` table for incremental sync. Avoids full-window rescans and handles pagination/rate limits.                                                                                                               |
| ADAPTERS_NOT_IN_CORE        | Source adapters live in `services/scheduler-worker/` behind a port interface. `packages/ledger-core/` contains only pure domain logic (types, rules, errors).                                                                                 |

## Project Scoping

The ledger uses two orthogonal scoping keys:

- **`node_id`** (UUID) — Deployment identity. Identifies the running instance. One node = one database, one set of infrastructure, one `docker compose up`. Never overloaded for governance semantics. See [identity-model spec](./identity-model.md).
- **`scope_id`** (TEXT) — Governance/payout domain. Identifies which **project** an epoch, its activity, and its payouts belong to. A project is a human-defined ownership boundary (e.g., "chat service", "shared infrastructure", "code review daemon") with its own DAO, weight policy, and payment rails.

**Terminology:** "Project" is the human concept. `scope_id` is the canonical database key. `scope_id` is not necessarily a filesystem path — path-based routing is one resolver strategy, but scopes can also be assigned by repository, by label, or by explicit declaration.

**V0 default:** All nodes start with a single scope: `scope_id = 'default'`. The `DEFAULT 'default'` column constraint means existing single-project nodes require zero migration. Multi-scope support activates when `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` manifests are added.

**Composite invariants:**

- `ONE_ACTIVE_EPOCH` → `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id) WHERE status != 'finalized'`
- `EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE` → `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id, period_start, period_end)`
- Workflow IDs include scope: `ledger-collect-{scopeId}-{periodStart}-{periodEnd}`

**Scope resolution at ingestion:**

1. Activity event arrives (e.g., a merged PR touching `apps/chat/src/thread.ts`)
2. Resolver maps the event to a `scope_id` using project manifest rules (file path patterns, repository name, explicit labels)
3. If the resolved `scope_id` is not in the current manifest set, the event is **rejected** (not silently dropped, not assigned to default)
4. Events touching files in multiple scopes generate **one event per scope** (the same PR can attribute to multiple projects)

**Scope validation:** The `scope_id` on every `activity_events` row must reference a scope declared in `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` (or be `'default'`). This is enforced at the application layer during ingestion — not via FK constraint, since manifests are YAML files, not DB rows.

## Design

### System Architecture

**Next.js** handles authentication (SIWE), authorization (admin check), read queries (direct DB), and write request enqueuing (start Temporal workflow, return 202).

**Temporal worker** (`services/scheduler-worker/`) handles all write/compute actions: activity collection via source adapters, identity resolution, allocation computation, epoch finalization. All workflows are idempotent via deterministic workflow IDs. The worker imports pure domain logic from `@cogni/ledger-core` and DB operations from `@cogni/db-client`.

**`packages/ledger-core/`** contains pure domain logic shared between the app and the worker: model types, `computePayouts()`, `computeProposedAllocations()`, and error classes. `src/core/ledger/public.ts` re-exports from this package so app code uses `@/core/ledger`.

**Postgres** stores the append-only activity events with DB-trigger enforcement of immutability.

### Auth Model (V0 — Simplified)

SIWE wallet login provides `{ id, walletAddress }` in the session. Authorization is a per-scope wallet allowlist — no multi-role `ledger_issuers` table in V0.

**Approver configuration** follows the repo-spec pattern (committed to repo, no env override, same as `node_id` and `dao_contract`):

```yaml
# .cogni/repo-spec.yaml — V0 default scope
ledger:
  approvers:
    - "0xYourWalletAddress"
```

V0 has one scope (`default`), so `ledger.approvers` in repo-spec.yaml is the single source of truth. When multi-scope activates, each `.cogni/projects/*.yaml` carries its own `ledger.approvers[]` list, overriding the repo-spec default for that scope.

Loaded via `getLedgerConfig()` in `repoSpec.server.ts`, validated by Zod schema (array of EVM addresses), cached at startup.

Admin capability (wallet must be in scope's `approvers[]`) required for:

- Triggering activity collection (or let Temporal cron handle it)
- Adjusting allocation `final_units`
- Triggering epoch finalize
- Recording pool components
- Signing payout statements (EIP-191, required before finalize)

Read routes are public — anyone can view epochs, activity, allocations, and payout statements.

### Activity Ingestion

Source adapters collect contribution activity from external systems and normalize it into `activity_events`. Each adapter:

1. **Connects** to one external system via official OSS client (`@octokit/graphql`, `discord.js`)
2. **Fetches** events since last cursor (or within the epoch time window)
3. **Normalizes** to `ActivityEvent` with deterministic ID, provenance fields, and platform identity
4. **Inserts** idempotently (PK conflict = skip)

Identity resolution happens after ingestion: lookup `user_bindings` (from [decentralized-identity spec](./decentralized-user-identity.md)) to map `(source, platform_user_id)` → `user_id`. Unresolved events are flagged for admin attention.

### Weight Policy

Credit allocation uses a simple per-event-type weight configuration stored as integer milli-units:

```jsonc
// Example weight_config (stored in epoch.weight_config JSONB)
{
  "github:pr_merged": 8000, // 8.000 units
  "github:review_submitted": 2000, // 2.000 units
  "github:issue_closed": 1000, // 1.000 units
  "discord:message_sent": 500, // 0.500 units
}
```

Proposed allocation per user = SUM of weights for their attributed events. The weight config is pinned per epoch (stored in the epoch row) for reproducibility.

### Epoch Lifecycle

Epoch status models **governance finality**, not payment execution. Distribution state lives on `payout_statements`.

```
1. OPEN          Temporal cron (weekly) or admin triggers collection
                 → Creates epoch with status='open', period_start/period_end + weight_config
                 → Runs source adapters → activity_events (raw facts)
                 → Resolves identities → updates user_id on curation rows
                 → Computes proposed allocations → epoch_allocations
                 → Admin curates: adjust inclusion, resolve identities, record pool components

2. REVIEW        Ingestion closed — raw facts locked, human judgment still active
                 → No new activity_events (DB trigger rejects inserts for this epoch)
                 → Curation still mutable: adjust inclusion, weight overrides, identity resolution
                 → Admin reviews + tweaks proposed allocations (not blindly trusting the algo)
                 → Allocations recomputed on demand from curated events + weight_config
                 → Admin signs payout statement (1-of-N EIP-191 from scope approvers)

3. FINALIZED     Admin triggers finalize (requires signature + base_issuance)
                 → Reads epoch_allocations (final_units, falling back to proposed_units)
                 → Reads pool components → pool_total_credits
                 → computePayouts(allocations, pool_total) → payout_statement
                 → Stores statement + signature atomically → epoch immutable forever
```

**Transitions:**

- `open → review`: Auto via Temporal at `period_end + grace_period` (configurable, default 24h), **or** admin triggers early via API route. Same state, different trigger.
- `review → finalized`: Admin action. Requires 1-of-N EIP-191 signature from scope's `approvers[]` + at least one `base_issuance` pool component.
- No backward transitions. Corrections use `supersedes_statement_id` on a new statement.

### Payout Computation

Unchanged from the original design. Given finalized allocations and a total pool:

1. Collect `final_units` per user (fall back to `proposed_units` if `final_units` is NULL)
2. Compute each user's share: `user_units / total_units`
3. Distribute `pool_total_credits` proportionally using BIGINT arithmetic
4. Apply largest-remainder rounding to ensure exact sum equals pool total
5. Output: `[{ user_id, total_units, share, amount_credits }]`

The allocation set hash (SHA-256 of canonical allocation data, sorted by user_id) pins the exact input set. Combined with `pool_total_credits` and `weight_config`, the payout is fully deterministic and reproducible.

### Pool Model

Unchanged. Each epoch's credit budget is the sum of independently computed pool components:

- **`base_issuance`** — constant amount per epoch (bootstraps early-stage work)
- **`kpi_bonus_v0`** — computed from DAO-defined KPI snapshots with pinned algorithm
- **`top_up`** — explicit governance allocation with evidence link

Each component stores `algorithm_version`, `inputs_json`, `amount_credits`, and `evidence_ref`.

### Verification

`GET /api/v1/ledger/verify/epoch/:id` performs independent verification from **stored data only** (not re-fetching from GitHub/Discord, which may be private or non-deterministic):

1. Fetch all `activity_events` for the epoch
2. Recompute proposed allocations from events + stored `weight_config`
3. Read `epoch_allocations` (final_units)
4. Recompute payouts from allocations + pool components
5. Compare recomputed values against stored statement
6. Return verification report

Constraints:

- Partial unique index `UNIQUE (node_id, scope_id) WHERE status != 'finalized'` enforces ONE_ACTIVE_EPOCH per (node, scope)
- `UNIQUE(node_id, scope_id, period_start, period_end)` enforces EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE

### `activity_events` — append-only contribution records (Layer 1)

| Column             | Type        | Notes                                                             |

Composite PK: `(node_id, id)`. The `scope_id` is not part of the PK — the same raw event ID is unique per node regardless of scope. Scope assignment happens at ingestion time and is immutable (ACTIVITY_APPEND_ONLY). No `epoch_id` — epoch membership assigned at curation layer. No `user_id` — identity resolution lands in `activity_curation.user_id` (truly immutable raw log).

DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE (ACTIVITY_APPEND_ONLY). `scope_id` validated against manifest at ingestion (SCOPE_VALIDATED).

Indexes: `(node_id, scope_id, event_time)`, `(source, event_type)`, `(platform_user_id)`

### `activity_curation` — identity resolution + admin decisions (Layer 2)

| Column                  | Type             | Notes                                            |

Constraint: `UNIQUE(epoch_id, event_id)`

DB trigger rejects INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE when `epochs.status = 'finalized'` (CURATION_FREEZE_ON_FINALIZE). Mutable during `open` and `review`, immutable after finalize. Reviewers can adjust inclusion, weight overrides, and identity resolution during review — these are auditable human decisions, not silent edits.

### `epoch_allocations` — per-user credit distribution

| Column            | Type             | Notes                                              |

Primary key: `(node_id, scope_id, source, stream, source_scope)`

Note: `source_scope` is the external system's namespace (GitHub repo slug, Discord guild ID). `scope_id` is the internal project governance domain. One `scope_id` may map to multiple `source_scope` values (a project that spans multiple repos).

### `epoch_pool_components` — immutable, append-only, pinned inputs

Unchanged from original spec. See [original schema](#pool-model).

DB trigger rejects UPDATE/DELETE (POOL_IMMUTABLE).
Constraint: `UNIQUE(epoch_id, component_id)` (POOL_UNIQUE_PER_TYPE).

### `payout_statements` — one per closed epoch, derived artifact (Layer 3)

| Column                    | Type                      | Notes                                               |

Post-signing corrections use amendment statements (`supersedes_statement_id`), never reopen-and-edit.

### `statement_signatures` — client-side EIP-191 signatures (schema only)

| Column          | Type                      | Notes                        |

Constraint: `UNIQUE(statement_id, signer_wallet)`

Signer wallet is the `ecrecover`-derived address, not client-supplied. Signature message must include `node_id + scope_id + allocation_set_hash` (SIGNATURE_SCOPE_BOUND). See [Signing Workflow](#signing-workflow).

## Source Adapter Interface

```typescript
// Port definition (src/ports/source-adapter.port.ts)

export interface SourceAdapter {
  readonly source: string; // "github", "discord"
  readonly version: string; // bump on schema changes

  streams(): StreamDefinition[];

  /**
   * Collect activity events. Idempotent (deterministic IDs).
   * Uses cursor for incremental sync. Returns events + next cursor.
   */
  collect(params: {
    streams: string[];
    cursor: StreamCursor | null;
    window: { since: Date; until: Date };
    limit?: number;
  }): Promise<{ events: ActivityEvent[]; nextCursor: StreamCursor }>;

  /** Optional webhook handler for real-time fast-path (GitHub). */
  handleWebhook?(payload: unknown): Promise<ActivityEvent[]>;
}

export interface ActivityEvent {
  id: string; // deterministic: "github:pr:owner/repo:42"
  source: string;
  eventType: string;
  platformUserId: string; // GitHub numeric ID, Discord snowflake
  platformLogin?: string; // display name
  artifactUrl: string;
  metadata: Record<string, unknown>;
  payloadHash: string; // SHA-256 of canonical payload
  eventTime: Date;
}

export interface StreamDefinition {
  id: string; // "pull_requests", "reviews", "messages"
  name: string;
  cursorType: "timestamp" | "token";
  defaultPollInterval: number; // seconds
}

export interface StreamCursor {
  streamId: string;
  value: string;
  retrievedAt: Date;
}
```

Adapters live in `services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/ingestion/` (ADAPTERS_NOT_IN_CORE). They use official OSS clients: `@octokit/graphql` for GitHub, `discord.js` for Discord.

## API

### Write Routes (SIWE + scope approver check → Temporal workflow → 202)

| Method | Route                                       | Purpose                                                                  |

| PATCH  | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs/:id/allocations`     | Admin adjusts final_units for users (epoch must be `open` or `review`)   |
| POST   | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs/:id/pool-components` | Record a pool component for the epoch (epoch must be `open` or `review`) |
| POST   | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs/:id/close-ingestion` | Close ingestion, transition `open → review` (or auto via Temporal)       |
| POST   | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs/:id/sign`            | Submit EIP-191 signature for payout statement (epoch must be `review`)   |
| POST   | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs/:id/finalize`        | Finalize epoch → compute payouts (requires signature + base_issuance)    |

### Read Routes (public)

| Method | Route                                   | Purpose                                      |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/v1/ledger/epochs`                 | List all epochs                              |

| GET    | `/api/v1/ledger/verify/epoch/:id`       | Recompute payouts from stored data + compare |

## Temporal Workflows

### CollectEpochWorkflow

1. Create or find epoch for the target `(node_id, scope_id)` + time window (EPOCH_WINDOW_UNIQUE)
2. Check no epoch currently active for a different window within this scope (ONE_ACTIVE_EPOCH)
3. For each registered source adapter:
   - Activity: load cursor from `source_cursors`
   - Activity: `adapter.collect({ streams, cursor, window })` → events
   - Activity: insert `activity_events` (idempotent by PK)
   - Activity: save cursor to `source_cursors`
4. Activity: resolve identities — lookup `user_bindings` for each `(source, platform_user_id)` → set `user_id`
5. Activity: compute proposed allocations from events + weight_config → insert `epoch_allocations`

Deterministic workflow ID: `ledger-collect-{scopeId}-{periodStart}-{periodEnd}`

### FinalizeEpochWorkflow

1. Verify epoch exists and is `review`
2. If epoch already `finalized`, return existing statement (EPOCH_FINALIZE_IDEMPOTENT)
3. Verify at least one `base_issuance` pool component exists (POOL_REQUIRES_BASE)
4. Verify at least one valid signature exists from scope's `approvers[]` (APPROVERS_PER_SCOPE)
5. Read `epoch_allocations` — use `final_units` where set, fall back to `proposed_units`
6. Read pool components, compute `pool_total_credits = SUM(amount_credits)`
7. `computePayouts(allocations, pool_total)` — BIGINT, largest-remainder
8. Compute `allocation_set_hash`
9. Atomic transaction: set `pool_total_credits` on epoch, update status to `'finalized'`, insert payout statement
10. Return statement

Deterministic workflow ID: `ledger-finalize-{scopeId}-{epochId}`

## Signing Workflow

### Canonical Message Format

The signed message binds to node, scope, and allocation data (SIGNATURE_SCOPE_BOUND):

```
Cogni Payout Statement
Node: {node_id}
Scope: {scope_id}
Epoch: {epoch_id}
Allocation Hash: {allocation_set_hash}
Pool Total: {pool_total_credits}
```

Frontend constructs this message from epoch data, calls `walletClient.signMessage()` (EIP-191 `personal_sign`), and POSTs the signature to the sign route.

### Verification

Backend recovers the signer address via `ecrecover(message, signature)` and checks:

1. Recovered address is in the scope's `approvers[]` (from repo-spec or project manifest)
2. Message fields match the epoch's actual data (prevents signing stale/wrong data)

### Storage

Signatures stored in `statement_signatures` table (schema unchanged). The `signer_wallet` is the recovered address, not client-supplied.

### Future Path

```
V0 (now):    DB-stored EIP-191 sigs, 1-of-N from scope approvers
V1:          Multi-sig thresholds (close_epoch_threshold: 2), separate curation_admins vs payout_approvers
V1:          Post sig hash to IPFS/Arweave → content hash on-chain
V2:          On-chain attestation registry (smart contract accepts epoch_hash + sig)
V3:          DAO multisig (Safe) — N-of-M signers required
```

## V1+ Deferred Features

The following are explicitly deferred from V0 and will be designed when needed:

- **Multi-sig thresholds** (`close_epoch_threshold: N`) — V1: require N-of-M approver signatures
- **Role separation** (`curation_admins` vs `payout_approvers`) — V1: separate who curates from who signs
- **`ledger_issuers` role system** (can_issue, can_approve, can_close_epoch) — V1: multi-role authorization
- **Per-receipt wallet signing** (EIP-191, SIGNATURE_DOMAIN_BOUND) — V1: receipts as signed artifacts
- **Receipt approval lifecycle** (proposed → approved → revoked, LATEST_EVENT_WINS) — V1: per-receipt workflows
- **On-chain attestation** — V0 verifies by recomputing from stored data; V1+ adds on-chain signature registry
- **Merkle trees / inclusion proofs** — V1+
- **Payout distribution state machine** (`payout_statements.status`: draft → signed → submitted → settled/failed) — V1+
- **UI pages** — V1+
- **DID/VC alignment** — V2+
- **Automated webhook fast-path** (GitHub `handleWebhook`) — V1: real-time ingestion

## Goal

Enable transparent, verifiable credit distribution where contribution activity is automatically collected, valued via explicit weight policy, and finalized by an admin. Anyone can recompute the payout table from stored data.

## Non-Goals

- Algorithmic valuation (SourceCred-style scoring) — weights are transparent, admin adjustable
- Server-held signing keys
- Full RBAC system (V0 uses per-scope approver allowlist)
- Real-time streaming (poll-based collection sufficient for weekly epochs)

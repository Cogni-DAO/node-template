# Financial Ledger: Double-Entry Treasury with On-Chain Settlement

## Goal

All money I/O in one place. Inbound USDC → treasury postings. Attribution statements → MerkleDistributor claim trees. Users claim on-chain with inclusion proofs. Beancount is the canonical ledger; Postgres stores operational state. Rotki enriches crypto transaction history and tax lots but is NOT the canonical ledger.

## Core Invariants

| Rule                         | Constraint                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BEANCOUNT_CANONICAL          | Beancount journal files are the source-of-truth financial ledger. All monetary state is reproducible from the journal.                                                                                                                  |
| ATTRIBUTION_NOT_FINANCIAL    | A signed attribution statement is a governance commitment (who earned what share), NOT a financial event. No money moves at epoch finalization.                                                                                         |
| FUNDING_IS_FINANCIAL         | Emissions funding of the MerkleDistributor IS a financial event. Entry: Dr Liability:UnclaimedEquity / Cr Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI.                                                                                                  |
| CLAIM_IS_FINANCIAL           | User on-chain claim from the distributor IS a financial event (liability reduction).                                                                                                                                                    |
| ROTKI_ENRICHMENT_ONLY        | Rotki for crypto transaction enrichment and tax lot validation. NOT the canonical ledger.                                                                                                                                               |
| EQUITY_PRIMARY               | Governance/rewards token distributions are the primary token distribution instrument. USDC distributions are governance-voted, not automated.                                                                                           |
| MERKLE_CLAIMS                | Stock per-epoch MerkleDistributor (Uniswap pattern, Base mainnet) is the preferred MVP on-chain distribution rail. User-initiated claims with inclusion proofs. Not Splits push distribution.                                           |
| MULTI_INSTRUMENT             | Beancount hierarchy tracks all instrument types (equity tokens, USDC, future). Financial events are instrument-typed. Settlement policy determines which instruments are active.                                                        |
| OPERATOR_PORT_REQUIRED       | Treasury actions (fund distributor, rotate Merkle roots, contract management, batch operations) require an Operator Port — a signing + policy boundary with rate limits, approvals, allowlists, and audit logs. NOT a custodial wallet. |
| ALL_MATH_BIGINT              | No floating point in monetary calculations. Inherited from attribution-ledger.                                                                                                                                                          |
| TRUSTED_MVP_EXPLICIT         | MVP claim publication/funding is trusted governance execution (Safe/manual or equivalent), NOT on-chain emissions enforcement. The trust model must be stated explicitly in product and operator docs.                                  |
| SETTLEMENT_MANIFEST_REQUIRED | Every published distribution records a settlement manifest containing `epochId`, `statementHash`, `merkleRoot`, `totalAmount`, `fundingTxHash`, `publisher`, and `publishedAt`.                                                         |

## Accounts Hierarchy (Beancount)

```
; --- Equity Token (primary distribution instrument) ---
Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI       ; Pre-minted equity tokens awaiting release
Assets:Distributor:COGNI          ; Tokens locked in MerkleDistributor per epoch
Liability:UnclaimedEquity         ; Committed but unclaimed equity token distributions

; --- USDC (revenue + governance-voted distributions) ---
Assets:Treasury:USDC              ; DAO treasury wallet (inbound revenue)
Assets:Distributor:USDC           ; Funds locked in MerkleDistributor (governance-voted payouts)
Liability:UnclaimedUSDC           ; Committed but unclaimed USDC distributions (future)

; --- P&L ---
Expense:ContributorRewards:Equity ; Equity token distributions (automated per epoch)
Expense:ContributorRewards:USDC   ; USDC distributions (governance-voted, future)
Income:ServiceRevenue             ; Inbound payments for AI services
Income:x402Settlements            ; x402 per-request settlement revenue
```

## Financial Events

**Automated (per epoch):**

1. **Epoch signed (optional accrual)**: Dr Expense:ContributorRewards:Equity / Cr Liability:UnclaimedEquity. No tokens move.
2. **EmissionsVault funds distributor**: Dr Liability:UnclaimedEquity / Cr Assets:EmissionsVault:COGNI. Equity tokens move on-chain via Operator Port.
3. **User claims equity tokens on-chain**: Liability reduction via MerkleDistributor claim.

**Governance-voted (future, not automated):**

4. **USDC distribution approved**: Governance vote passes → Dr Expense:ContributorRewards:USDC / Cr Assets:Treasury:USDC. Operator Port funds a separate USDC MerkleDistributor (or same contract, different token).
5. **User claims USDC on-chain**: Same MerkleDistributor claim pattern, different token.

## Design

MVP settlement path:

1. Attribution finalization produces a signed `AttributionStatement`.
2. Settlement resolves each finalized claimant to a wallet address. Epochs with unresolved claimants remain governance-finalized but are not settlement-eligible.
3. `computeMerkleTree()` derives leaves from statement-line `credit_amount` entitlements and maps them into `GovernanceERC20` token amounts under the active settlement policy.
4. The settlement token is the Aragon `GovernanceERC20` minted at node formation to a DAO-controlled emissions holder.
5. DAO-controlled trusted execution (Safe/manual or equivalent) publishes a per-epoch Merkle root and funds the distributor. No second statement-signing step is introduced at settlement time.
6. Settlement publication stores a signed settlement manifest linking `epochId`, `statementHash`, `merkleRoot`, `totalAmount`, `fundingTxHash`, `publisher`, and `publishedAt`.

Lifecycle:

```
node formation
  -> fixed GovernanceERC20 supply minted to emissions holder
  -> epoch finalized as signed AttributionStatement
  -> settlement manifest + Merkle root derived from signed `credit_amount`
  -> DAO-controlled publish + fund
  -> contributor claims tokens on-chain
```

See [proj.financial-ledger](../../work/projects/proj.financial-ledger.md) for the implementation roadmap.

## Enforcement Progression

The signed `AttributionStatement` contains `poolTotalCredits` — but nothing in the attribution pipeline hard-enforces that this value respects the budget policy. The enforcement point is the **token release from the emissions holder**, not the statement itself.

| Phase     | What enforces the budget cap?                                                                                                                                                                                     | Source of truth for remaining supply                                                                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Crawl** | Nothing automated. Off-chain pure functions compute `epoch_pool`, but a bug or direct DB write can inflate `poolTotalCredits`. Admin reviews the signed statement.                                                | `budget_bank_ledger.remaining_after` in Postgres                                                                                   |
| **Walk**  | Safe signers verify the funding amount against budget policy before authorizing each token release. The emissions holder's on-chain balance is the hard cap — you cannot release more tokens than the holder has. | `emissionsHolder.balanceOf(token)` on-chain. Postgres `remaining` becomes a reconciliation check; if they diverge, the chain wins. |
| **Run**   | `EmissionsController` contract enforces `amount ≤ maxPerEpoch` and `totalReleased + amount ≤ totalSupply` via `require()`. Over-budget transactions revert.                                                       | On-chain contract state. Postgres is an index/cache.                                                                               |

**If the signed statement says 50K credits but the budget allows 10K:** In Crawl, nothing stops it. In Walk, the Safe signers reject the funding transaction. In Run, the contract reverts it.

## Threat Model

| Threat                                                                                      | MVP controls                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Signed statement contains `poolTotalCredits` exceeding budget policy                        | Walk: Safe signers verify amount against policy before authorizing release. Run: EmissionsController `require()` reverts over-budget. |
| Malicious maintainer changes settlement code or publication inputs before release           | Branch protection, required review, signed releases or build attestations, and reproducible settlement artifacts.                     |
| Compromised operator publishes a root early or funds a distributor with the wrong amount    | Safe/manual publish-and-fund policy, limited publisher set, and manifest review before execution.                                     |
| Statement/root mismatch: a valid signed statement exists, but a different root is published | Settlement manifest stores `statementHash`, and the published root is derived from the signed statement rather than ad hoc balances.  |
| Replay or duplicate publication for an epoch                                                | One settlement publication record per epoch plus explicit operator review before any replacement action.                              |
| Overfunding distributor beyond the intended epoch amount                                    | Funding amount must equal manifest `totalAmount`, reconciled against settlement record, journal entry, and emissions holder balance.  |

## Non-Goals

- Bespoke emissions enforcement in MVP
- Speculative token economics (co-op patronage, not governance tokens)
- Postgres as financial ledger (Postgres is operational state; Beancount is canonical)
- Raw private key env vars (Operator Port uses keystore/Vault/CDP, never raw keys)

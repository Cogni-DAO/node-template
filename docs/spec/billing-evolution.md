# Billing Evolution: Dual-Cost Accounting

## Context

Extends accounts design with profit-enforcing billing and provider cost tracking. LiteLLM is the cost oracle; our system applies markup and stores idempotent charge receipts.

**Related docs:**

- System architecture: [Accounts Design](../ACCOUNTS_DESIGN.md)
- API contracts: [Accounts API Endpoints](../ACCOUNTS_API_KEY_ENDPOINTS.md)
- Wallet integration: [Wallet Auth Setup](../INTEGRATION_WALLETS_CREDITS.md)
- Usage/Activity Design: [Activity Metrics](./activity-metrics.md)
- Graph Execution & Idempotency: [Graph Execution](graph-execution.md)

## Goal

Single-path billing where LiteLLM provides provider cost, our system applies markup, and charge receipts are immutable audit records with idempotency guarantees.

## Non-Goals

- Hardcoded per-model USD pricing tables (LiteLLM is the oracle)
- Blocking user responses during post-call billing
- Credit holds / soft reservations (deferred, tracked in proj.payments-enhancements.md)

## Core Invariants

1. **CREDIT_UNIT_STANDARD**: 1 credit = $0.0000001 USD. `CREDITS_PER_USD = 10_000_000` is a protocol constant (hardcoded, not configurable). All balances stored as BIGINT integers.

2. **LITELLM_COST_ORACLE**: LiteLLM computes per-request cost via `x-litellm-response-cost` header (non-streaming) or `usage.cost` in final usage event (streaming). We do NOT maintain hardcoded per-model pricing tables.

3. **SINGLE_BILLING_PATH**: `providerCostUsd → userCostUsd = providerCostUsd × MARKUP_FACTOR → chargedCredits = ceil(userCostUsd × CREDITS_PER_USD)`. Single entry point: `calculateLlmUserCharge()`.

4. **IDEMPOTENT_CHARGE_RECEIPTS**: `UNIQUE(source_system, source_reference)` is the idempotency constraint. Multiple receipts per `request_id` allowed (graphs make N LLM calls). Each receipt maps to a `credit_ledger` entry.

5. **USER_COST_NOT_PROVIDER_COST**: `response_cost_usd` stores USER cost (with markup), not provider cost.

6. **POST_CALL_NEVER_BLOCKS**: Post-call billing NEVER throws `InsufficientCreditsPortError`. If balance goes negative, log critical but complete the write. Overage handled in reconciliation.

## Schema

**Table:** `charge_receipts`

Minimal audit-focused table. LiteLLM is canonical for telemetry.

| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 credit          | $0.0000001 USD                                                  |

| Default markup    | 2.0× (100% markup = 50% margin)                                 |

## Design

### Post-Call Billing (Non-Blocking)

Per [Activity Metrics](./activity-metrics.md), post-call billing NEVER throws `InsufficientCreditsPortError`.

**Flow:**

1. **Preflight** (blocking): estimate cost, check balance, DENY if insufficient
2. **Call LiteLLM** via LlmService
3. **Extract cost** from `x-litellm-response-cost` header or `usage.cost` event
4. **Calculate chargedCredits** via `calculateLlmUserCharge()`
5. **Write atomically**: `recordChargeReceipt()` (non-blocking, never throws InsufficientCredits)
6. **Return response** to user (NEVER blocked by post-call billing)

If balance goes negative, log critical but complete the write. Overage handled in reconciliation.

### Environment Configuration

| Variable                   | Purpose                  | Example |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| `USER_PRICE_MARKUP_FACTOR` | Profit markup multiplier | `2.0`   |

Protocol constant `CREDITS_PER_USD = 10_000_000` is NOT configurable (hardcoded).

### Known Issues (Resolved)

- [x] **Table rename done.** `llm_usage` → `charge_receipts`

### File Pointers

| `src/ports/accounts.port.ts`                      | `recordChargeReceipt` interface                      |
| `src/adapters/server/accounts/drizzle.adapter.ts` | Atomic charge receipt + ledger debit                 |
| `src/features/ai/services/completion.ts`          | Preflight gating + non-blocking post-call billing    |

## Acceptance Checks

**Invariants to verify:**

- 1 credit = $0.0000001 (protocol constant)
- `response_cost_usd` stores user cost (with markup), not provider cost
- Single ceil at end: `chargedCredits = ceil(userCostUsd × CREDITS_PER_USD)`
- Post-call billing NEVER blocks user response
- Idempotency via `UNIQUE(source_system, source_reference)` — see [Graph Execution](graph-execution.md)

**Verification:**

```sql
SELECT charged_credits, response_cost_usd FROM charge_receipts;
```

Cost source: LiteLLM `usage.cost` (stream) or `x-litellm-response-cost` header (non-stream).

## Known Issues

- **/activity cost column broken**: LiteLLM `spend_logs.request_id` ≠ `charge_receipts.litellm_call_id` for some providers → all rows show "—" cost. See [bug.0004.activity-billing-join](../../work/items/bug.0004.activity-billing-join.md).

## Open Questions

_(none — planned work tracked in proj.payments-enhancements.md: pre-call max-cost estimation, reconciliation scripts, credit_holds table, on-chain watcher, cents sprawl cleanup, conservative pre-call estimate tuning)_

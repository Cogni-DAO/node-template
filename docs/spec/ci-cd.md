# CI/CD Pipeline Flow

## Overview

This spec defines the target CI/CD model for the repo:

- `main` is the only long-lived code branch
- pull requests prove safety before merge in fixed `candidate-*` slots
- accepted code promotes forward from `main` without rebuilds
- deploy branches hold environment state only and are reconciled by Argo CD

This document supersedes the old canary-first branch model. Existing workflows may still reflect legacy behavior during migration, but new design work should follow this spec rather than the older branch semantics.

## Core Axioms

1. **`main` is code truth**. It holds safe, accepted code.
2. **Code merges when safe, not merely when ready**. Incomplete work should be hidden behind flags or stay in PRs.
3. **Pre-merge safety happens in candidate or flight slots**. Do not call those lanes `canary`.
4. **Build once, promote by digest**. Downstream environments never rebuild artifacts.
5. **Deploy branches are environment state only**. `deploy/*` branches contain rendered deployment state, not product code.
6. **Argo owns reconciliation**. CI writes desired state to git; Argo syncs from git.
7. **Affected-only CI is the default**. Required checks should scope to the changed surface where practical.
8. **Release branches are exceptional only**. They are not the default path for accepted code.
9. **Direct edits to `deploy/*` are incident-only**. Repair the live environment first when necessary, then mirror the fix back into the normal source-of-truth path.
10. **Agent guidance is part of the control plane**. Prompts, skills, AGENTS files, and workflow docs must not tell agents to PR into or diff against legacy branches.

## Branch And Deploy-State Model

```text
feature/* → PR → main                               (app code)
deploy/candidate-a, deploy/candidate-b, ...        (pre-merge env state)
deploy/preview, deploy/production                  (post-merge env state)
```

- **Feature branches** are short-lived and PR into `main`.
- **`main`** is the only long-lived shared code branch.
- **`deploy/candidate-*`** branches hold desired state for pre-merge safety lanes.
- **`deploy/preview`** and **`deploy/production`** hold desired state for post-merge promotion lanes.
- CI writes deployment state directly to deploy branches; Argo watches those branches and syncs the cluster.

**Key invariant**: CI never pushes application code to protected app branches.

**Key invariant**: Promotion means changing desired state in a deploy branch, not rebuilding an image.

## Delivery Lanes

mainBranch --> previewEnv[PreviewEnv]
previewEnv --> productionEnv[ProductionEnv]
```

### PR Lane

The PR lane is authoritative for merge safety in v0.

1. `pull_request` runs affected-only CI where available.
2. CI builds an immutable image for the exact PR head SHA.
3. The PR-head artifact is the authoritative v0 artifact.
4. Passing PRs become ready for manual candidate flight.
5. A human explicitly chooses which PR to flight next.
6. That chosen PR is deployed to `candidate-a` through `deploy/candidate-a`.
7. Candidate validation runs against the stable slot URL.
8. `candidate-flight` is authoritative for PRs explicitly sent to flight, but standard CI and build remain the universal merge gate in v0.

### Main Lane

The main lane is authoritative for promotion, not for pre-merge acceptance.

1. Merge to `main` records the accepted PR SHA.
2. The same proven digest promotes forward without rebuild.
3. `preview` is the first required post-merge promotion lane in v0.
4. Production promotion happens from the same digest by policy.

If a post-merge soak lane is retained later, it must be modeled as an explicitly named environment with a distinct purpose. The term `canary` must not be reused for pre-merge acceptance.

Merge queue is deferred in v0. If the repo later adopts merge queue, the workflow graph must add `merge_group` support and revisit artifact authority explicitly instead of assuming the PR-head artifact still maps cleanly to the accepted merge candidate.

## Minimum Authoritative Validation For V0

Do not block the rewrite on perfect black-box E2E maturity. For PRs explicitly sent to candidate flight in the current prototype, the required flight gate is:

- affected-only static checks plus unit tests
- successful image build for the exact PR SHA
- candidate deployment reaches healthy pods
- a prototype smoke pack passes:
  - `/readyz` returns `200` on operator, poly, and resy
  - `/livez` returns structured JSON on operator, poly, and resy
- any human or AI validation needed to call the change safe

Optional but non-authoritative in v0:

- auth or session sanity paths
- chat or completion probes
- scheduler or worker sanity probes
- one or two node-critical API probes
- richer black-box E2E suites
- AI probe jobs against the changed surface
- broader post-merge soak analysis

## Environment Model

### Candidate Environments

Candidate environments are fixed, pre-running slots reused across PRs. They exist to validate selected unknown code before merge without creating a new VM per PR.

| Environment | Deploy Branch        | Purpose                      |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| candidate-a | `deploy/candidate-a` | manual pre-merge safety slot |

Start with `candidate-a` only. Add `candidate-b` later only after the one-slot prototype is proven stable.

### Promotion Environments

Promotion environments run accepted code only.

| Environment | Deploy Branch       | Purpose               |
| ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| preview     | `deploy/preview`    | post-merge validation |
| production  | `deploy/production` | production            |

This spec does not require a `canary` environment. If one is retained during migration, it must be described explicitly as a post-merge soak lane and not as a branch or as a pre-merge safety lane.

### Preview Review Lock

`deploy/preview` holds a small state directory, `.promote-state/`, that drives merge-to-main flighting. Three files:

- **`candidate-sha`** — the most recent successfully built merge-to-main SHA. High-water mark. Written unconditionally on every flight attempt (`unlocked`, `dispatching`, or `reviewing`). Policy is **latest-wins, not FIFO**: if a hotfix is queued behind a later merge, only the latest is retained.
- **`current-sha`** — the SHA actually deployed to preview and under human review. Written only after a preview deploy reaches the E2E success step. `create-release.sh` reads this to cut release branches.
- **`review-state`** — `unlocked | dispatching | reviewing`. This is a pre-dispatch lease, not a boolean.

Transitions:

| From → To                 | Written by                                                  | Trigger                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `unlocked → dispatching`  | `scripts/ci/promote-to-preview.sh`                          | merge to main (or manual flight dispatch); atomic with `candidate-sha` update |
| `dispatching → reviewing` | `lock-preview-on-success` job in `promote-and-deploy.yml`   | preview deploy reaches E2E success; writes `current-sha`                      |
| `dispatching → unlocked`  | `unlock-preview-on-failure` job in `promote-and-deploy.yml` | any of `promote-k8s`, `deploy-infra`, `verify`, `e2e` fail                    |
| `reviewing → unlocked`    | `auto-merge-release-prs.yml`                                | release PR merges                                                             |

On release-merge unlock, if `candidate-sha != current-sha` the workflow dispatches a fresh flight with `sha=candidate-sha` to drain the queue. A flight concurrency group (`flight-preview`) serializes entry to the `unlocked → dispatching` transition; the three-value lease is the correctness guarantee even if concurrency is bypassed.

**Direct pushes to main are not a supported flight trigger.** The flight workflow re-tags `pr-{N}-{sha}` → `preview-{sha}` in GHCR and requires an associated PR number; direct pushes exit 0 with a message.

## Workflow Design Targets

When implementation begins, workflow changes should follow these rules:

1. **Two lanes only**. One PR safety lane and one main promotion lane.
2. **No branch-name inference for environment routing**. Environment selection must be explicit input, artifact metadata, or deployment-state driven.
3. **No default `release/* -> main` conveyor**. If production still needs explicit approval, make it an environment or promotion control rather than a separate accepted-code branch.
4. **No duplicate orchestration**. E2E, promote, and deploy ownership should be clear rather than split across overlapping workflow graphs.
5. **No legacy branch guidance in prompts or docs**. Agents should not be told to diff against or PR into `staging` or a long-lived `canary` branch.

## Deploy Branch Rules

- Deploy branches are long-lived, machine-written environment-state refs.
- They may contain image digests, overlay patches, and other deployment facts such as environment endpoints.
- They are never merged back into app branches.
- PRs are not required for routine automated deploy-state updates; git history is the audit trail.
- Push access on `deploy/*` should be restricted to the CI app or bot, with incident-only human bypass if needed.
- Rollback is by reverting deployment-state commits.

## Known Unknowns

Track these explicitly during the spec rewrite, following the CI/CD scorecard style of keeping unresolved questions visible:

- [ ] **Candidate selection and slot control**
      Define the manual flight trigger, lease, timeout, cleanup, and status ownership without building a queueing system into v0.
- [ ] **E2E validation workflows**
      Decide what stays in the authoritative v0 gate versus what remains advisory, and define how smoke tests, richer black-box E2E, and post-merge validation divide across the PR lane and main lane.
- [ ] **Git-manager agent as a first-class control-plane actor**
      Define whether a git-manager style agent owns PR build tracking, candidate slot coordination, deploy-branch promotion, and status reporting, or whether those responsibilities stay in plain workflows with agent assistance around them.
- [ ] **OpenFeature flags**
      Decide how feature flags reduce PR scope, shrink risky surface area, and let code merge when safe without requiring every incomplete capability to be fully user-exposed.
- [ ] **Merge queue integration later**
      If concurrency pressure eventually justifies merge queue, add `merge_group` workflows and revisit authoritative artifact selection at that time rather than mixing both models in v0.

## Legacy Surfaces To Retire

The following patterns are now legacy and should be removed during implementation:

- long-lived `staging` or `canary` code-branch semantics
- branch-based environment inference in workflow logic
- prompts, skills, AGENTS files, or workflow docs that steer agents toward `origin/staging` or PRs into non-`main` branches
- release branch enforcement as the normal path for accepted code
- namespace, overlay, or deploy-state naming that still encodes `staging` for the preview lane

## Non-Goals For V0

This spec does not require:

- fully dynamic per-PR ephemeral environments
- perfect end-to-end coverage before adopting the model
- a production release branch for every accepted change
- a decision today on every future soak, canary, or experimentation lane

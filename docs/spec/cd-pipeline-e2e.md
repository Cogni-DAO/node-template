# CD Pipeline E2E: Multi-Node Argo CD GitOps

> End-to-end specification for continuous deployment of operator + node apps via
> Argo CD on k3s, with Docker Compose infrastructure services on the same VM.

> Historical note: the original canary/staging-era version of this document has been preserved at [`docs/spec/cd-pipeline-e2e-legacy-canary.md`](./cd-pipeline-e2e-legacy-canary.md).
> For branch-model axioms and the target operating rules, treat [`docs/spec/ci-cd.md`](./ci-cd.md) as the source of truth.

## Status

- **Target code branch model:** feature branches and PRs into `main`
- **Target deploy-state model:** `deploy/candidate-*`, `deploy/preview`, `deploy/production`
- **Date:** 2026-04-08
- **Constraint:** keep the strong parts of the multi-node GitOps design, while replacing branch semantics, artifact authority, and workflow ownership that were built around `staging` or a long-lived `canary` branch

## 0. Directory Structure: `infra/` Reorganization

Everything about "how the system runs" lives under one umbrella: `infra/`. The previous
layout mixed inventory, provisioning, runtime renderers, and image builds in a flat layer.
The new layout splits by responsibility.

### Current → Target

| Current Path                   | Target Path                   | Responsibility                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `infra/cd/`                    | `infra/k8s/`                  | Kubernetes renderer (Argo CD + Kustomize)  |
| _(new)_                        | `infra/catalog/`              | Thin inventory: what apps/nodes exist      |
| `infra/compose/`               | `infra/compose/`              | VM-shared infra runtime (stays)            |
| `infra/litellm/`               | `infra/images/litellm/`       | Infra-owned image build contexts           |
| `infra/compose/sandbox-proxy/` | `infra/images/sandbox-proxy/` | Infra-owned image build contexts           |
| `infra/tofu/`                  | `infra/provision/`            | Substrate/bootstrap (OpenTofu, cloud-init) |
| `infra/tofu/akash/`            | `infra/akash/`                | Future Akash renderer (SDL, not TF)        |

```

### Design Principles

**One umbrella, not two.** A separate `deploy/` would split brain. Every deployment concern
(Caddy routing, LiteLLM callbacks, DB provisioning, bootstrap) crosses the
runtime and renderer boundary. Keeping everything in `infra/` means one place to look.

**Split by responsibility, not by anxiety.** Each subdirectory has one job:

| Directory    | Answers the question                      | Changes when...                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `catalog/`   | "What apps/nodes exist?"                  | A new node is added                    |
| `k8s/`       | "How do apps deploy to Kubernetes?"       | Image digests change, manifests change |
| `compose/`   | "What infra services run on the VM?"      | Infrastructure config changes          |
| `images/`    | "How are infra-owned images built?"       | LiteLLM/proxy code changes             |
| `provision/` | "How is the VM created and bootstrapped?" | Cloud provider or bootstrap changes    |
| `akash/`     | "How do apps deploy to Akash?"            | (Future — SDL renderer)                |

**`catalog/` must stay thin.** It answers only "what exists and which renderer inputs
belong to it." K8s details stay in `k8s/`. Compose details stay in `compose/`.

**Deploy state is not app code.** App code lives on feature branches and `main`.
Rendered environment state lives on `deploy/*` branches watched by Argo.

## 1. Architecture Overview

Single VM per environment. Two runtimes coexist:

| Runtime            | Manages                                                                    | Why                                                                      |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker Compose** | Infrastructure: Postgres, Temporal, LiteLLM, Redis, Caddy, Alloy, Autoheal | Stateful, rarely changes, no GitOps churn needed                         |
| **k3s + Argo CD**  | Applications: Operator, Poly, Resy, Scheduler-Worker, Sandbox-OpenClaw     | Frequent changes, benefits from declarative sync, self-healing, rollback |

│  Caddy :443 → k3s NodePort (operator, poly, resy)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Decision: Operator Moves to k3s

The operator app currently runs on Compose. For multi-node, it must move to k3s alongside
poly and resy.

1. **Uniform deploy path** — all apps deploy the same way: image build → deploy-state update → Argo sync
2. **Uniform networking** — all apps are k3s Services, reachable by ClusterIP
3. **LiteLLM routing** — `COGNI_NODE_ENDPOINTS` can use k3s service DNS or NodePort routes consistently
4. **Self-healing** — Argo restarts crashed operator, not just nodes

### Operator Scope Clarification

The operator is both a formation factory and a running Cogni node with its own payments,
billing, and database. It is the first node in the network. Moving to k3s changes only the
deploy mechanism, not the operator's responsibilities.

### Billing Topology

LiteLLM is the single LLM proxy. All nodes call LiteLLM for completions. LiteLLM routes
billing callbacks back to each node's `/api/internal/billing/ingest`.

```text
Node (k3s pod) → LiteLLM (Compose, port 4000) → OpenRouter
                      ↓ (async callback)
                 CogniNodeRouter reads node_id from spend_logs_metadata
                      ↓
                 POST to node's billing endpoint via COGNI_NODE_ENDPOINTS
                      ↓
                 Node (k3s pod, via NodePort from Compose)
```

All traffic flows through localhost on the same VM. No cross-network routing.

### 3.2 Bootstrap Ordering

| Gap                                                | Problem                                                              | Solution                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DB must exist before Argo syncs apps**           | Argo will start pods that need DATABASE_URL pointing to existing DBs | Provision DBs before the first app sync of a fresh environment                |
| **LiteLLM must be healthy before app pods**        | App health depends on LiteLLM proxy                                  | Compose infra starts first; apps sync after foundational services are healthy |
| **Temporal must be ready before scheduler-worker** | Scheduler-worker fails if Temporal unreachable                       | Compose Temporal comes up before the scheduler-worker sync or readiness gate  |

Bootstrap ordering remains valid under the trunk-based model. What changes later is how candidate, preview, and production environments receive digests and how their deploy branches are updated.

## 4. E2E Flow: Code Change → Production

### 4.1 CI Pipeline (Target Model)

This section replaces the old staging-first flow. The target model has two lanes only.

| Lane | Stage | Job / Concern          | What Happens                                                                            | Output                         |

| Main | 10    | **promote-production** | Same digest promotes to `deploy/production` by policy                                   | Production deploy-state commit |

### 4.2 Authoritative Artifact Rule

This is the single most important unresolved design choice before workflow surgery starts.

The system currently wants all of the following:

- `pull_request` and `merge_group` participate in pre-merge validation
- CI builds the exact pre-merge artifact
- the same proven digest promotes after merge

Those only line up if one artifact authority model is chosen explicitly.

| Option                      | Description                                                   | Pros                                                               | Cons                                                        |

| **A. PR SHA artifact**      | Build the PR head SHA and treat it as authoritative           | Fast PR feedback, simpler local reasoning                          | Weak if merge queue rebases or batches changes              |
| **B. merge-group artifact** | Build the merge-group candidate and treat it as authoritative | Strongest fit for merge queue; exact artifact that lands on `main` | Requires merge-group workflow support and artifact plumbing |
| **C. rebuild on `main`**    | Rebuild after merge and promote the new artifact              | Operationally simple to describe                                   | Violates build-once promotion and reintroduces drift        |

**Constraint:** no workflow rewrite should begin until this spec picks between A and B. Option C is incompatible with the target model.

### 4.3 Image Build Matrix

| App               | Dockerfile                                 | Build Trigger                                              | Tag / Identity Direction                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| operator          | `nodes/operator/app/Dockerfile`            | Changes to operator, shared packages, or shared infra      | immutable digest, human-friendly tag derived from authoritative artifact |
| operator-migrator | `nodes/operator/app/Dockerfile` (migrator) | Changes to migrations, schema, drizzle config              | immutable digest plus fingerprint metadata                               |
| poly              | `nodes/poly/app/Dockerfile`                | Changes to `nodes/poly/`, shared packages, or shared infra | immutable digest                                                         |
| resy              | `nodes/resy/app/Dockerfile`                | Changes to `nodes/resy/`, shared packages, or shared infra | immutable digest                                                         |
| scheduler-worker  | `services/scheduler-worker/Dockerfile`     | Changes to `services/scheduler-worker/`                    | immutable digest                                                         |
| litellm           | `infra/images/litellm/Dockerfile`          | Changes to `infra/images/litellm/`                         | should move toward digest-pin parity with the rest                       |

### 4.4 Promotion Flow

Promotion must be explicit and environment-driven, not branch-name-driven.

```text
PR update or merge-group run
  → ci.yaml
  → build-multi-node.yml
  → candidate-slot controller chooses candidate-a or candidate-b
  → promote-and-deploy.yml writes digests to deploy/candidate-*
  → Argo syncs candidate slot
  → validation runs
  → PR becomes mergeable

Merge to main
  → promote-and-deploy.yml writes same digest to deploy/preview
  → Argo syncs preview
  → post-merge validation runs
  → same digest later promotes to deploy/production
```

**Why separate workflows still matter:** a workflow that commits to the same branch that triggered it is fragile. That concern survives the trunk rewrite. Deploy-state updates should happen on deploy branches, with distinct orchestration and concurrency groups.

**Key detail:** the accepted artifact must flow through deploy branches unchanged. Preview and production should receive the same digest that was accepted pre-merge.

### 4.5 Validation Authority In V0

Validation authority must be blunt, not implied.

- **Required in v0:** branch protection plus the required candidate-lane checks
- **Advisory in v0:** AI probes and broader exploratory validation
- **Optional by policy:** extra human signoff for sensitive surfaces if enforced separately from CI

Preview is not a pre-merge bottleneck in v0. It validates already-accepted code after merge.

### 4.6 Rollback

| Scenario             | Action                              | Effect                                                |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Bad app code         | `git revert` deploy-branch commit   | Argo syncs previous digest                            |
| Bad migration        | Manual intervention required        | Drizzle has no auto-rollback; write reverse migration |
| Bad config           | Update ConfigMap/Secret, Argo syncs | Pod restarts with new config                          |
| Full rollback        | Revert all overlay changes          | All apps return to previous version                   |
| Single node rollback | Revert only that node's overlay     | Only that node's pod restarts                         |

## 6. Networking

### 6.1 k3s → Compose (Apps Reaching Infrastructure)

Uses selectorless Services plus EndpointSlices pointing to `127.0.0.1`.

| k3s Service         | Target    | Compose Service | Port |
| ------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ---- |
| `postgres-external` | 127.0.0.1 | postgres        | 5432 |
| `temporal-external` | 127.0.0.1 | temporal        | 7233 |
| `litellm-external`  | 127.0.0.1 | litellm         | 4000 |
| `redis-external`    | 127.0.0.1 | redis           | 6379 |

### 6.2 Compose → k3s (LiteLLM Reaching Node Billing Endpoints)

LiteLLM runs on Compose and must POST billing callbacks to each node's `/api/internal/billing/ingest`.

| Option                    | How                                                                   | Complexity                  | Chosen? |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| **k3s NodePort**          | Each node app exposes a NodePort, LiteLLM hits `127.0.0.1:{nodePort}` | Low                         | **Yes** |
| **k3s HostPort**          | Pod spec includes `hostPort`, bypasses Service                        | Low but fragile             | No      |
| **Shared Docker network** | Connect k3s container network to Compose                              | Complex, breaks isolation   | No      |
| **kubectl port-forward**  | Forward pod ports to localhost                                        | Fragile, not for production | No      |

### 6.3 Caddy → k3s (External Traffic to Node Apps)

| Approach                                  | How                                                                   | Pros                          | Cons                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Caddy → NodePort per app**              | Each app has a NodePort, Caddy routes by subdomain                    | Simple, no k8s ingress needed | NodePort allocation management |
| **Caddy → k3s Ingress**                   | Re-enable traefik or install nginx-ingress, Caddy forwards to ingress | Clean routing, standard k8s   | Extra component, double proxy  |
| **Caddy → single NodePort + Host header** | One ingress NodePort routes by Host                                   | Minimal NodePorts             | Requires ingress controller    |

**Recommended:** Caddy → NodePort per app for the current footprint.

### 6.4 NodePort Allocation

| App              | ClusterIP Port | NodePort | Purpose       |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| operator         | 3000           | 30000    | Main app      |
| poly             | 3000           | 30100    | Poly node     |
| resy             | 3000           | 30300    | Resy node     |
| scheduler-worker | 9000           | —        | Internal only |
| sandbox-openclaw | 18789          | —        | Internal only |

## 7. Secrets Management

### 7.1 Secret Layers

| Layer                  | Scope                            | Encryption                           | Managed By                                              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Secrets**     | CI builds + deploy orchestration | GitHub-managed                       | `pnpm setup:secrets`                                    |
| **K8s Secrets (SOPS)** | k3s app pods                     | age encryption at rest in Git        | ksops CMP decrypts at apply                             |
| **Compose .env**       | Compose infra services           | Not encrypted on VM filesystem       | `scripts/ci/deploy-infra.sh` writes from GitHub Secrets |
| **Terraform vars**     | VM provisioning                  | `terraform.auto.tfvars` (gitignored) | `pnpm setup:secrets`                                    |

### 7.2 Per-Node K8s Secrets

Each node needs its own encrypted Secret in `infra/k8s/secrets/{env}/{node}.enc.yaml`.

| Secret Key             | Operator              | Poly                  | Resy                  | Shared?                          |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`         | `cogni_operator` DB   | `cogni_poly` DB       | `cogni_resy` DB       | No — per-node DB                 |
| `DATABASE_SERVICE_URL` | Same DB, service role | Same DB, service role | Same DB, service role | No — per-node DB                 |
| `AUTH_SECRET`          | Unique per node       | Unique per node       | Unique per node       | No — origin-scoped sessions      |
| `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`   | Shared                | Shared                | Shared                | Yes — single LiteLLM instance    |
| `BILLING_INGEST_TOKEN` | Shared                | Shared                | Shared                | Yes — same auth for billing POST |
| `INTERNAL_OPS_TOKEN`   | Shared                | Shared                | Shared                | Yes                              |

### 7.3 Candidate Slot Secret Question

One implementation detail still needs a policy decision:

- candidate slots can each have their own secret layer
- or candidate slots can inherit a shared non-prod secret layer

This document keeps that open, but the secret tree and deploy workflows must eventually encode one rule consistently.

## 8. Database Migrations

### 8.1 Current State

Migrations currently run as a one-shot container using the migrator image target. In the target model, migration execution must follow the same authoritative artifact chosen for candidate validation and later promotion.

### 8.2 Multi-Node Migration Strategy

All nodes share the same schema. Each node has its own database.

| Approach                          | How                                                                                 | Pros                   | Cons                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Argo PreSync Job per node**     | K8s Job runs migrator image with node-specific DATABASE_URL before Deployment syncs | GitOps-native, ordered | Need Job manifest per node   |
| **Single multi-DB migration Job** | One Job iterates `COGNI_NODE_DBS`, migrates each                                    | Simple, one manifest   | Failure on one DB blocks all |
| **Init container**                | App pod runs migrations on startup                                                  | No separate Job        | Races if multiple replicas   |
| **CI step**                       | Migrations run before Argo sync                                                     | Decoupled from Argo    | Breaks GitOps purity         |

**Recommended:** Argo PreSync Job per node.

### 8.3 Migration Ordering

```text
Argo Sync Wave:
  PreSync (wave -1): provision databases if needed
  PreSync (wave 0):  run migrations per node
  Sync (wave 1):     deploy app pods
  PostSync:          health verification
```

## 9. ApplicationSet Design

### 9.1 Current Problem

The old design hardcoded environment paths and app lists inside Argo configuration. That does not scale with node formation or with candidate-slot deploy branches.

### 9.2 Target: Git File Generator With Deploy-Branch Revisions

```yaml
generators:
  - git:
      repoURL: https://github.com/cogni-dao/cogni-template.git
      revision: deploy/preview
      files:
        - path: "infra/catalog/*.yaml"
```

Each catalog file remains thin:

```yaml
name: poly
type: node
overlay_path: infra/k8s/overlays/preview/poly
namespace: cogni-preview
```

### 9.3 Environment Sets

| ApplicationSet / Group | Watches                | Target Revision      | Namespace           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| `cogni-candidate-a`    | `infra/catalog/*.yaml` | `deploy/candidate-a` | `cogni-candidate-a` |
| `cogni-candidate-b`    | `infra/catalog/*.yaml` | `deploy/candidate-b` | `cogni-candidate-b` |
| `cogni-preview`        | `infra/catalog/*.yaml` | `deploy/preview`     | `cogni-preview`     |
| `cogni-production`     | `infra/catalog/*.yaml` | `deploy/production`  | `cogni-production`  |

If a separate post-merge soak environment exists later, add it explicitly here. Do not smuggle it in through legacy `canary` semantics.

### 9.4 Candidate Slot Control Hooks

ApplicationSets alone are not enough. The control plane also needs:

- a way to decide which candidate branch is currently assignable
- a lease model for in-use slots
- cleanup semantics when a PR is superseded or closed

Those rules belong in workflow and controller logic, but the Argo model must leave room for them.

## 10. Critical Gap Analysis

### 10.1 Trunk-Alignment Gaps

| #   | Gap                                                           | Severity | What Exists                                                                    | What's Needed                                                       | Effort    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| G1  | **Authoritative artifact rule unresolved**                    | Blocker  | `pull_request`, `merge_group`, and same-digest promotion are all desired       | Choose PR artifact vs merge-group artifact and encode it everywhere | 0.5-1 day |
| G2  | **Candidate slot controller undefined**                       | Blocker  | Candidate-slot concept exists in prose only                                    | Define lock, TTL, cancellation, cleanup, and status ownership       | 1 day     |
| G3  | **Validation authority too squishy**                          | Blocker  | Human and AI validation mentioned loosely                                      | State required vs advisory checks in v0                             | 0.5 day   |
| G4  | **Preview semantics can drift back into gate behavior**       | High     | Preview exists, but legacy habits may reuse it as shared pre-merge bottleneck  | Keep preview post-merge only in workflow and docs                   | 0.5 day   |
| G5  | **Legacy branch semantics remain in workflows and docs**      | High     | `staging`, `canary`, and `release/* -> main` assumptions still appear in files | Purge workflow, prompt, AGENTS, and namespace drift                 | 1-2 days  |
| G6  | **Deploy routing still inferred from branch names**           | High     | Current workflow logic still maps env from branch names                        | Make environment routing explicit and deploy-state driven           | 1 day     |
| G7  | **Production can still drift from accepted artifact lineage** | High     | Legacy rebuild assumptions still exist in some paths                           | Ensure preview and production consume the accepted digest lineage   | 1 day     |

### 10.2 Multi-Node Gaps That Still Matter

| #   | Gap                                                             | Severity | What's Needed                                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G8  | **LiteLLM image still needs parity with digest-pinned deploys** | Medium   | Move toward the same reproducibility guarantees as app images |
| G9  | **Per-node AUTH_SECRET strategy needs to stay explicit**        | Medium   | Keep node-specific auth isolation in SOPS and env schema      |
| G10 | **Affected-only builds are still incomplete**                   | Medium   | Use Turbo or equivalent to scope PR costs                     |
| G11 | **Resource limits and observability need follow-through**       | Medium   | Profile actual usage and monitor Argo and app health          |

## 11. Infra Directory Layout (Target State)

See §0 for the top-level `infra/` reorganization. Below is the detailed `infra/k8s/` tree after trunk-aligned environment renaming:

```text
infra/k8s/
├── argocd/
│   ├── kustomization.yaml
│   ├── ksops-cmp.yaml
│   ├── repo-server-patch.yaml
│   ├── candidate-a-applicationset.yaml
│   ├── candidate-b-applicationset.yaml
│   ├── preview-applicationset.yaml
│   └── production-applicationset.yaml
├── base/
│   ├── node-app/
│   │   ├── deployment.yaml
│   │   ├── service.yaml
│   │   ├── configmap.yaml
│   │   ├── external-services.yaml

    └── production/
```

### 11.1 Shared Base Pattern

All node apps use `base/node-app/` as a shared Kustomize base. Overlays customize:

| Field                | Base (shared) | Overlay (per-node)               |
| -------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deployment replicas  | 1             | Override if needed               |
| Container image      | Placeholder   | `@sha256:...` digest             |
| Container port       | 3000          | 3000                             |
| Service NodePort     | —             | 30000, 30100, 30300              |
| ConfigMap: APP_ENV   | —             | candidate / preview / production |
| ConfigMap: NODE_NAME | —             | `operator` / `poly` / `resy`     |
| Secret ref           | —             | `{node}-secrets`                 |
| Migration Job image  | Placeholder   | Migrator `@sha256:...`           |

## 12. CI Workflow Changes Required

### 12.1 Workflow Ownership

| File                                       | Current Burden                        | Target Role                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`                | mixed PR and branch checks            | required PR and merge-group checks                              |
| `.github/workflows/build-multi-node.yml`   | branch-oriented build entrypoint      | authoritative artifact build entrypoint                         |
| `.github/workflows/promote-and-deploy.yml` | branch-inferred environment promotion | explicit candidate / preview / production deployment            |
| `.github/workflows/e2e.yml`                | legacy chained E2E path               | either retire or narrow to a single explicit validation concern |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml`            | legacy release conveyor               | re-evaluate; not default accepted-code path                     |

### 12.2 Build Matrix

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    app:
      - name: operator
        dockerfile: nodes/operator/app/Dockerfile
        context: .
      - name: poly
        dockerfile: nodes/poly/app/Dockerfile
        context: .
      - name: resy
        dockerfile: nodes/resy/app/Dockerfile
        context: .
      - name: scheduler-worker
        dockerfile: services/scheduler-worker/Dockerfile
        context: services/scheduler-worker
```

### 12.3 Promote Step (Generalized)

```bash
scripts/ci/promote-k8s-image.sh \
  --app operator \
  --digest ghcr.io/cogni-dao/cogni-template@sha256:abc... \
  --env candidate-a

# Updates: infra/k8s/overlays/candidate-a/operator/kustomization.yaml
```

The same interface should work for `candidate-b`, `preview`, and `production`.

### 12.4 Candidate Slot Orchestration Hooks

The workflow layer needs concrete hooks for:

- acquire slot
- renew or hold lease while validation is running
- release slot on success, failure, superseding push, PR close, or timeout
- post status back to the PR or merge queue

This may live in plain workflow logic, in a dedicated script, or in a git-manager style agent, but the owner must be explicit.

### 12.5 CLI Entry Points (Scripts Are The API)

| Script                                        | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/ci/promote-k8s-image.sh`             | Update overlay digest for a target app and env |
| `scripts/ci/check-gitops-manifests.sh`        | Validate Kustomize overlays render             |
| `scripts/ci/check-gitops-service-coverage.sh` | Validate catalog and overlay coverage          |
| `scripts/ci/deploy-infra.sh`                  | Reconcile Compose-managed infrastructure       |

## 13. Implementation Sequence

### Phase 0: Lock The Rules Before YAML Surgery

| Task                                  | Why                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Freeze authoritative artifact rule    | Prevent merge-queue and promotion drift      |
| Define candidate-slot operating rules | Prevent deadlocks and human-chaos slot usage |
| Define v0 validation authority        | Prevent ambiguous merge decisions            |

### Phase 1: Align The Specs And Control Plane

| Task                                                               | Why                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Finish `ci-cd.md` and this document                                | Docs become the source of truth                     |
| Update prompts, skills, AGENTS, and workflow docs                  | Prevent cultural regression back to legacy branches |
| Rename legacy environment references in namespace and overlay docs | Remove active semantic drift                        |

### Phase 2: Rewire Workflows

| Task                                                        | Why                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Rework `ci.yaml` for PR and merge-group authority           | Required checks must match accepted-code flow       |
| Rework `build-multi-node.yml` around authoritative artifact | Build once, promote once                            |
| Rework `promote-and-deploy.yml` around explicit env routing | Remove branch-name inference                        |
| Decide fate of `e2e.yml` and `release.yml`                  | Remove duplicate orchestration and legacy conveyors |

### Phase 3: Rewire Deploy-State And Argo

| Task                                                                                  | Why                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Create or standardize `deploy/candidate-*`, `deploy/preview`, and `deploy/production` | Argo must watch the right refs              |
| Update ApplicationSets and namespaces                                                 | Make runtime topology match the new model   |
| Verify migration and networking still hold across envs                                | Preserve the strong parts of the old design |

## 14. Risk Register

| Risk                                                  | Likelihood | Impact                                                       | Mitigation                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Merge queue and artifact mismatch**                 | High       | Accepted code differs from validated artifact                | Freeze artifact rule before workflow rewrites                       |
| **Candidate slot starvation or stale locks**          | High       | PRs stop flowing or require manual babysitting               | Define slot lease, TTL, and cleanup semantics                       |
| **Validation authority remains ambiguous**            | Medium     | Unsafe merges or unnecessary merge blocking                  | Make required vs advisory checks explicit                           |
| **Legacy guidance causes branch-model regression**    | High       | Agents and humans keep reintroducing staging/canary behavior | Purge prompts, AGENTS, and workflow docs                            |
| **Promotion drift from accepted digest lineage**      | Medium     | Preview or production diverges from accepted code            | Enforce build-once promotion through deploy branches                |
| **Compose↔k3s networking breaks during env renames** | Medium     | Billing callbacks or readiness fail                          | Preserve networking primitives while changing branch semantics only |

## 15. Open Questions And TODO Headers

- [ ] **Freeze authoritative artifact rule**
      Decide whether the authoritative artifact is the PR SHA or the merge-group artifact.
- [ ] **Define candidate-slot operating rules**
      Lock owner, lease, TTL, cancellation, cleanup, and overflow behavior when all slots are busy.
- [ ] **Define v0 validation authority**
      Pin which checks are required, which are advisory, and where optional human policy fits.
- [ ] **Decide merge queue integration model**
      Ensure required checks work on `merge_group` without creating a shadow integration branch.
- [ ] **Decide git-manager agent ownership boundaries**
      Define whether a first-class agent owns PR build tracking, slot coordination, promotion, and status fan-in.
- [ ] **Decide OpenFeature rollout expectations**
      Define how feature flags help code merge when safe rather than when every capability is fully released.

summary: "Visual reference for which token does what in our Polymarket V2 trade path. USDC.e is the public Polygon stablecoin used for wallet deposits and withdrawals; pUSD is Polymarket's protocol-internal 1:1 wrapper that V2 exchanges actually spend. CollateralOnramp is the 1:1 airlock between them. After V2 cutover (2026-04-28), USDC.e is phased out of the trade-execution path but remains the medium for incoming deposits. Enable Trading wraps a wallet's full USDC.e balance to pUSD on click; with task.0429 the auto-wrap consent loop keeps the wallet wrapped on a 60s scan cycle so deposits, V1 redeems, and external transfers no longer strand cash."
read_when: Reasoning about user funds on Polymarket, debugging insufficient_balance errors, designing UI that shows trading balance, adding new trade or deposit code paths, onboarding a new env's operator wallet, deciding whether the user needs a manual Enable Trading click after a deposit.

# Polymarket V2 collateral lifecycle

## Goal

Single visual reference for which token does what in our Polymarket V2 trade path. Anyone touching trade-currency code (trade execution, balance display, deposit flow, withdraw flow, Enable Trading) can read this once and know whether to reach for USDC.e or pUSD without having to read SDK source.

## Non-Goals

- Not a runbook for re-running Enable Trading per env (that's the bug.0419 doc on the work-item side).
- Not a contract-change tracker — V2 addresses are derived from `@polymarket/clob-client-v2`'s `getContractConfig(137)` at boot, so this doc lists them as ground-truth at write time, not as the code's source of authority.
- Does not cover withdraw / unwrap flow — pUSD → USDC.e is symmetric via the same Onramp but we don't expose it yet; future spec when that ships.

## Design

   external incoming —— stays on-chain as USDC.e until next Enable Trading wraps it
```

### Mental model

- **USDC.e** = how money enters/exits a wallet (the public Polygon stablecoin).
- **pUSD** = how money trades inside Polymarket V2 (the protocol-internal stablecoin).
- **CollateralOnramp** = the airlock between them. 1:1 in either direction, no fee.

Pre-V2 there was no airlock — V1 exchanges spent USDC.e directly. V2 introduced pUSD to give Polymarket protocol-level control of the trade collateral (cross-chain, fee mechanics, accounting). The wrap step is a one-time-per-deposit cost, not a per-trade cost.

### Is USDC.e phased out?

**On Polymarket: yes, for trading. As an asset on Polygon: no.**

| Question                                                                           | Answer                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can V2 exchanges spend USDC.e to fill orders?                                      | **No.** They only spend pUSD.                                                                                                                    |
| Will deposits from outside (Coinbase, bridges, personal wallets) arrive as USDC.e? | **Yes — for the foreseeable future.** USDC.e is the standard Polygon stablecoin; pUSD exists only inside Polymarket's protocol.                  |
| Does our flow still need USDC.e approvals?                                         | **Only one**: `USDC.e.approve(CollateralOnramp, ∞)` so Onramp can pull deposits to mint pUSD. After that, USDC.e is invisible to the trade path. |
| What's the wrap rate?                                                              | **1:1.** pUSD is a deterministic 1:1 wrapper of USDC.e. No fee, no slippage, no peg risk.                                                        |
| Can pUSD be unwrapped back to USDC.e?                                              | **Yes, via the same Onramp.** We don't expose this in our app yet — it's a one-call symmetric op for a future withdraw flow.                     |

### What our app does with each token

| Path                                    | Reads / writes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Display "trading balance" on Money page | Sum **USDC.e + pUSD** on-chain. Both are 1:1 USD; UI shows the total. (Code: `readPolygonBalances` in the privy adapter reads both and sums to the `usdcE` field name kept for now.)                                                                      |
| Enable Trading button                   | Wraps **all** USDC.e → pUSD on click. Steady state after one click: USDC.e ≈ 0, pUSD = wallet balance.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Mirror BUY                              | Spends **pUSD** via the V2 exchange. USDC.e is never touched at trade time.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| New deposit lands as USDC.e             | If the user has flipped on **Auto-wrap** (task.0429), the 60s job converts it to pUSD on the next tick (≤ 90s end-to-end). Without auto-wrap, it sits until the next Enable Trading click. UI still shows the correct total because we sum both balances. |
| V1 CTF redeem returns cash              | Pre-cutover positions redeem to USDC.e (`bug.0428` made this per-job correct). Same auto-wrap path picks them up. Post-cutover (V2) redeems land pUSD directly — no wrap needed.                                                                          |

### Contract addresses (Polygon mainnet, V2)

Sourced from `@polymarket/clob-client-v2`'s `getContractConfig(137)` plus one hardcode (CollateralOnramp is not in the SDK config):

| Role                | Address                                      | Notes                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USDC.e`            | `0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174` | Standard Polygon-native USDC, hardcoded in the adapter           |
| `pUSD`              | `0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB` | SDK config field: `collateral`                                   |
| `CollateralOnramp`  | `0x93070a847efEf7F70739046A929D47a521F5B8ee` | Hardcoded — not in SDK config. Exposes `wrap(asset, to, amount)` |
| `ExchangeV2`        | `0xE111180000d2663C0091e4f400237545B87B996B` | SDK config field: `exchangeV2`                                   |
| `NegRiskExchangeV2` | `0xe2222d279d744050d28e00520010520000310F59` | SDK config field: `negRiskExchangeV2`                            |
| `NegRiskAdapter`    | `0xd91E80cF2E7be2e162c6513ceD06f1dD0dA35296` | SDK config field: `negRiskAdapter` — unchanged from V1           |
| `CTF` (CTF tokens)  | `0x4D97DCd97eC945f40cF65F87097ACe5EA0476045` | SDK config field: `conditionalTokens` — unchanged from V1        |

### Enable Trading ceremony — 8 steps

After V2 cutover, the ceremony at `PolyTraderWalletPort.ensureTradingApprovals` is:

1. `USDC.e.approve(CollateralOnramp, MaxUint256)` — lets Onramp pull USDC.e on user's behalf.
2. `CollateralOnramp.wrap(USDC.e, funder, balance)` — mints `balance` pUSD to the funder; consumes the USDC.e.
3. `pUSD.approve(ExchangeV2, MaxUint256)`
4. `pUSD.approve(NegRiskExchangeV2, MaxUint256)`
5. `pUSD.approve(NegRiskAdapter, MaxUint256)` — belt-and-suspenders; adapter target may not always pull pUSD.
6. `CTF.setApprovalForAll(ExchangeV2, true)`
7. `CTF.setApprovalForAll(NegRiskExchangeV2, true)`
8. `CTF.setApprovalForAll(NegRiskAdapter, true)`

Idempotent: each step checks live state and skips when satisfied. Step 2 ("wrap") is the only stateful balance-moving call — runs whenever USDC.e balance > 0.

### Auto-wrap consent loop (task.0429)

The Enable Trading ceremony runs **once** per wallet. After that, the seven non-wrap approvals are sticky on-chain. Step 2 ("wrap") is the only one that needs to fire again whenever new USDC.e arrives. Three of four cash-return channels deliver USDC.e:

| Channel                               | Token landed |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Money-page deposit (`task.0352`)      | USDC.e       |
| V1 CTF redeem (pre-cutover positions) | USDC.e       |
| V2 CTF redeem (post-cutover)          | pUSD         |
| External transfer to funder           | USDC.e       |

Without intervention, three of these strand cash until the user clicks Enable Trading again. The auto-wrap loop closes that gap with a single user consent + a background job.

#### How it works — one click, perpetual loop

```
funder ──USDC.e──▶ [60s scan: consent + balance ≥ floor]
                            │
                            ▼
                  CollateralOnramp.wrap(...)
                            │
                            ▼
funder ──pUSD──▶ CLOB BUY ──▶ CTF position ──▶ resolves ──▶ redeem
   ▲                                                          │
   └──────────── USDC.e (V1) / pUSD (V2) ◀────────────────────┘
```

- User flips **Auto-wrap USDC.e → pUSD** on the Money page once. Stamps `poly_wallet_connections.auto_wrap_consent_at`.
- The trader pod runs a 60s `auto-wrap.job.ts` (modeled on `order-reconciler.job.ts`). Every tick it:
  1. Reads consenting + non-revoked rows from `poly_wallet_connections`.
  2. For each, reads on-chain USDC.e balance at the funder address.
  3. If balance ≥ `auto_wrap_floor_usdce_6dp` (default `1_000_000` = 1.00 USDC.e), submits the same pinned `CollateralOnramp.wrap(USDC.e, funder, balance)` call as the Enable Trading ceremony.
- Revoke flips `auto_wrap_revoked_at`. The next tick observes it and skips the row. The original `auto_wrap_consent_at` is preserved for forensics.

Read-then-act, not event-driven — there is no Transfer-log subscription. Every tick re-derives the decision from current on-chain balance + current DB consent. A revoke is honored on the next tick with no extra plumbing.

#### Floor — the dust guard

`auto_wrap_floor_usdce_6dp` (BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT `1_000_000`) is the minimum atomic USDC.e the job will wrap. Below floor → skip. Without this a malicious actor sending 1 wei USDC.e per minute could drain the funder's POL via wrap-tx gas fees. Floor is per-connection; v0 ships with the field hidden in UI (default applies to everyone).

#### Skip outcomes

`PolyTraderWalletPort.wrapIdleUsdcE` returns a structured `{ outcome: "skipped", reason }` for every non-wrap path. The job propagates `reason` into a metric label so each branch is observable independently:

| Reason            | Meaning                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no_consent`      | `auto_wrap_consent_at IS NULL` or revoked since (race-protection on the read path). |
| `no_balance`      | USDC.e balance is exactly 0.                                                        |
| `below_floor`     | Balance > 0 but < the floor — DUST_GUARD.                                           |
| `not_provisioned` | No active `poly_wallet_connections` row for the tenant.                             |

Throws (RPC unreachable, decryption error, Privy backend down) are caught at the job's per-row level and counted as `outcome: "errored"`; they never escape the interval.

## Invariants

- **TRADES_SPEND_PUSD** — V2 exchanges (`exchangeV2`, `negRiskExchangeV2`) only pull pUSD from a wallet at fill time. Granting them USDC.e allowance is a no-op and silently fails as `insufficient_balance` at the CLOB.
- **WRAP_IS_1_TO_1** — `CollateralOnramp.wrap(USDC.e, to, n)` mints exactly `n` units of pUSD to `to` and consumes exactly `n` USDC.e from the caller. No fee, no slippage. The reverse (unwrap) is symmetric and held for a future withdraw flow.
- **ONRAMP_NEEDS_USDC_E_ALLOWANCE** — `wrap` pulls USDC.e via `transferFrom`, so the caller MUST first `USDC.e.approve(CollateralOnramp, …)`. Step 1 of the Enable Trading ceremony exists for this reason.
- **APPROVAL_TARGETS_FROM_SDK_CONFIG** — exchange + collateral + CTF + adapter addresses are derived from `clob-client-v2`'s `getContractConfig(137)`. CollateralOnramp is hardcoded because it is not in the SDK config. No env override; misconfigured addresses would authorize an arbitrary spender to drain the wallet.
- **BALANCE_DISPLAY_IS_SUM** — UI / overview-API "trading balance" reads both USDC.e and pUSD on-chain and shows the sum. This makes a pre-wrap deposit visible to the operator without needing to wrap first.
- **ENABLE_TRADING_IS_THE_BRIDGE** — every wallet runs the 8-step ceremony exactly once per env to cross from V1-shaped state to V2-shaped state. Idempotent: each step checks live state and skips when already satisfied. After the first run, the seven non-wrap approvals are sticky on-chain; only the wrap step needs to recur, which is what the auto-wrap loop handles.
- **AUTO_WRAP_ON_CONSENT** — when `poly_wallet_connections.auto_wrap_consent_at IS NOT NULL AND auto_wrap_revoked_at IS NULL AND revoked_at IS NULL`, the trader pod's 60s `auto-wrap.job` MAY submit `CollateralOnramp.wrap(USDC.e, funder, balance)` for that wallet whenever USDC.e balance ≥ `auto_wrap_floor_usdce_6dp`. The job is read-then-act per tick; a revoke is honored on the next tick.
- **DUST_GUARD** — the auto-wrap job MUST skip rows where USDC.e balance is below `auto_wrap_floor_usdce_6dp` (default `1_000_000`). Prevents gas-on-dust drain via flood of 1-wei transfers.

## TL;DR

- USDC.e is **not** phased out as the deposit medium.
- USDC.e **is** phased out from the trade-execution path.
- The Enable Trading button is the bridge — every wallet runs it **once** per env, wrap-on-click, and from then on every BUY spends pUSD.
- Flip **Auto-wrap** on the Money page once. Every USDC.e arrival after that — deposit, V1 redeem, transfer — is converted to pUSD within 90s by a background job. Revoke any time.
- "Do I need pUSD?" → if auto-wrap is on, you already do (or will, within a tick). If off, click Enable Trading.

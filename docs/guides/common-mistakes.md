# Common Agent Mistakes

## Architecture Violations

- Import `adapters` from `features` or `core` (layer boundary violation)
- Create files in wrong architectural layer
- Import `@langchain/*` from `src/**` (must be in `packages/langgraph-graphs/`)
- Import internal files instead of public entry points (`public.ts`, `index.ts`)

## Contract & Type Mistakes

- Create manual type definitions for contract shapes (use `z.infer`)
- Modify contracts without updating dependent routes/services
- Skip contract-first: always update `src/contracts/*.contract.ts` before touching routes

## Tooling Misunderstandings

- Use `console.log` (use Pino server logger / clientLogger for browser)
- Running `pnpm check` after every small change — it takes 5-10 minutes. Run the specific suite for your change instead:

### Run the right test suite for your change

| What you changed | Run this |
|---|---|
| TypeScript types / imports | `pnpm typecheck` |
| Lint / formatting | `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm format` |
| `src/` unit logic | `pnpm test:unit` |
| Contract shapes | `pnpm test:contract` |
| `packages/` code | `pnpm test:packages:local` |
| `services/` code | `pnpm test:services:local` |
| Architecture / imports | `pnpm arch:check` |
| AGENTS.md / docs | `pnpm check:docs` |
| Specific test file | `pnpm vitest run path/to/file.test.ts` |

Run `pnpm check` as a final gate before commit — not after every edit.

**Do not run `pnpm check:full`** — it requires Docker and full stack infrastructure. Agents should use `pnpm check` only. CI handles the full validation.

## Documentation Mistakes

- Restate root AGENTS.md policies in subdirectory files
- Add "none" sections that add no information
- Write AGENTS.md for behavior details (keep those in file headers)

## When Things Fail

### dependency-cruiser violations

Output format: `error  no-<rule-name>: <from-path> → <to-path>`

Fix: check the `may_import` in the source directory's AGENTS.md and `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`. Move the import to the correct layer.

### Lint / format errors

Run `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm format` to auto-fix most issues.

### Architecture test failures

Check `tests/arch/` — these validate layer boundaries. If a new import path is legitimate, update `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` and the relevant AGENTS.md boundaries.

### Type errors after contract changes

Update all consumers: `z.infer<typeof SomeContract>` will propagate the change. Search for the contract name to find all dependents.

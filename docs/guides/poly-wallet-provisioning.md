# Poly per-tenant Trading Wallet — Provisioning Runbook

> Operator-facing runbook for task.0318 Phase B. Covers what's shipped in PR #968 and what to do to exercise it on candidate-a. Pairs with [poly-trader-wallet-port](../spec/poly-trader-wallet-port.md) (the contract) and [poly-multi-tenant-auth](../spec/poly-multi-tenant-auth.md) (tenant-isolation shape).

## Architecture (honest accounting)

There are three places poly-wallet code lives. This **is** a split; reviewers should know why.

```
packages/poly-wallet/                           ← Port + types ONLY
├── src/port/poly-trader-wallet.port.ts         ← PolyTraderWalletPort interface
└── src/index.ts                                ← re-export

nodes/poly/app/src/adapters/server/wallet/      ← Adapter class (node-local)
└── privy-poly-trader-wallet.adapter.ts         ← PrivyPolyTraderWalletAdapter

nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/                   ← Factory + env wiring
└── poly-trader-wallet.ts                       ← getPolyTraderWalletAdapter()
```

**Why three locations, not one:**

1. **Port in a shared package** — per `docs/spec/packages-architecture.md`, capability ports live in `packages/` so any runtime (app, future scheduler-worker, future Temporal activities) can depend on them without pulling in node-local deps.
2. **Adapter in `nodes/poly/app/src/adapters/server/wallet/` instead of `packages/poly-wallet/src/adapters/privy/`** — the adapter reads the `poly_wallet_connections` table which lives in `@cogni/poly-db-schema` (itself node-local to poly per task.0324 per-node schema independence). If the adapter lived in the package, the package would import node-local schema — a boundary violation. Co-locating with `@cogni/poly-db-schema` keeps the package boundary clean.
3. **Bootstrap factory in `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/poly-trader-wallet.ts` instead of the adapter file** — ESLint `no-restricted-imports` forbids `@/adapters/**` imports from `nodes/*/app/src/app/**/*` (routes). Routes import from `@/bootstrap/**`; bootstrap imports from `@/adapters/**`. The factory is that bridge.

**Smells a reviewer should know about:**

- **Three locations for one capability is more moving parts than an ideal single-package story.** The reason it isn't one package today is the `@cogni/poly-db-schema` dependency — if/when per-node DB schemas move into their own packages that shared packages can depend on, the adapter could move to `packages/poly-wallet/src/adapters/privy/`. Today it shouldn't.
- **`biome-ignore lint/suspicious/noExplicitAny` on two sites in the adapter** — `createViemAccount` from `@privy-io/node/viem` ships its own viem (`2.48.1`) as a peer-dep; this app pins `2.39.3`. The shapes are runtime-identical but TypeScript rejects the assignment across the two installations. The exact same `const x: any = account` workaround is used in `nodes/poly/app/src/bootstrap/capabilities/poly-trade.ts:696-700` for the operator-wallet signer. Clean fix = unify viem versions, out of scope for this slice.
- **v0 CLOB creds factory is a stub** returning `"placeholder-*"` strings. Gated behind `POLY_WALLET_ALLOW_STUB_CREDS=1`; the bootstrap throws at startup if the flag isn't "1" and real CLOB derivation isn't wired. Non-trade-eligible until a follow-up lands `@polymarket/clob-client createOrDeriveApiKey`.
- **`provision` generates the row id via a Postgres roundtrip** (`SELECT gen_random_uuid()::text`) instead of `crypto.randomUUID()`. Noise, should be removed in the test PR.
- **No tests yet.** The spec pins 11 acceptance checks; this PR ships zero. Landing a 1-tenant component round-trip test is the gate before any production rollout.

## Candidate-a exercise path

### 1. Create a NEW Privy app for user wallets (manual, one-time)

**Separate from the operator-wallet Privy app** — `SEPARATE_PRIVY_APP` invariant. Reasons in [poly-trader-wallet-port § Env](../spec/poly-trader-wallet-port.md#env--separation-of-system-and-user-wallet-privy-apps).

1. Sign in at <https://dashboard.privy.io> (Cogni-DAO account).
2. "Create app" → name it `cogni-user-wallets-candidate-a` (or similar).
3. Enable **server wallets** for the app.
4. Mint an **authorization key** (base64-encoded PKCS8 EC private key) — needed for `POST /v1/wallets` signed requests.
5. Record `appId`, `appSecret`, `signingKey`.

### 2. Generate the AEAD key

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32   # 64 hex chars = 32 bytes for AES-256-GCM
```

Choose a key id (e.g., `v1`) — `POLY_WALLET_AEAD_KEY_ID` is stored on every row so you can rotate without breaking existing rows later.

### 3. Set GH env secrets at `candidate-a` scope

```bash
gh secret set PRIVY_USER_WALLETS_APP_ID --env candidate-a
gh secret set PRIVY_USER_WALLETS_APP_SECRET --env candidate-a
gh secret set PRIVY_USER_WALLETS_SIGNING_KEY --env candidate-a
gh secret set POLY_WALLET_AEAD_KEY_HEX --env candidate-a
gh secret set POLY_WALLET_AEAD_KEY_ID --env candidate-a
# Gate for the v0 stub CLOB-creds factory — set "1" to allow plumbing tests.
gh secret set POLY_WALLET_ALLOW_STUB_CREDS --env candidate-a --body 1
```

The first 5 are missing → `getPolyTraderWalletAdapter` throws `WalletAdapterUnconfiguredError` → route returns 503 cleanly. No panic.

### 4. Flight to candidate-a

After this PR merges to `main`, trigger:

```bash
gh workflow run candidate-flight-infra.yml --ref main
```

Verify:

- **Endpoint cutover** clears (buildsha matches `/readyz.version`).
- Env reached the pod: `pod-exec poly-node-app -- env | grep PRIVY_USER_WALLETS_APP_ID` shows the new id (truncated; don't log the secret).

### 5. Exercise the provision endpoint

```bash
SESSION_COOKIE=<your-candidate-a-session>

curl -X POST https://candidate-a-poly.cogni-dao.net/api/v1/poly/wallet/connect \
  -H "Cookie: $SESSION_COOKIE" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "custodialConsentAcknowledged": true,
    "custodialConsentActorKind": "user",
    "custodialConsentActorId": "<your-user-id>"
  }'
```

**Expected response** (idempotent — second call returns same `connection_id`):

```json
{
  "connection_id": "<uuid>",
  "funder_address": "0x…",
  "requires_funding": true,
  "suggested_usdc": 5,
  "suggested_matic": 0.1
}
```

### 6. Observability handshake

Loki query (replace `<sha>` with the deployed SHA):

```logql
{job="poly-node-app",sha="<sha>"}
  |= "poly.wallet.connect"
  | json
  | line_format "{{.billing_account_id}} {{.connection_id}} {{.funder_address}}"
```

Expect 1 info line per successful request, plus (because the stub is in use) a WARN line `poly.wallet.provision using STUB CLOB creds — NOT tradeable, plumbing test only`.

### 7. Deploy-verified handshake

When the provision call returns 200 AND the Loki line appears at the deployed SHA, this slice is exercised. Comment on PR #968:

> `deploy_verified`: candidate-a POST /api/v1/poly/wallet/connect returned 200 with connection_id=… funder_address=… at SHA=…; Loki line seen at …

## Follow-up work before B3 ships

Ordered by blocking priority:

1. **Real CLOB L2 creds factory** — wire `@polymarket/clob-client createOrDeriveApiKey` as a `clobCredsFactory` injection; drop the `POLY_WALLET_ALLOW_STUB_CREDS` gate in the factory.
2. **Component test(s)** — testcontainers PG + stubbed Privy mock; prove `provision → resolve → getAddress → revoke → resolve=null` round-trip under two tenants with RLS defense-in-depth. Covers review-feedback r3 gap #6.
3. **Orphan reconciler** — `scripts/ops/sweep-orphan-poly-wallets.ts` dry-run + `--apply`. Covers `NO_ORPHAN_BACKEND_WALLETS`.
4. **`authorizeIntent` implementation** — requires `poly_wallet_grants` table (B4) + windowed fills-cap queries.
5. **`withdrawUsdc` implementation** — ERC-20 transfer via Privy HSM; requires `WITHDRAW_BEFORE_REVOKE` UX in the dashboard (B3).
6. **Agent-API-key auth path** — unlock `custodialConsentActorKind: "agent"` in the route (currently 501).
7. **viem version unification** — drop the two `noExplicitAny` ignores in the adapter once `@privy-io/node`'s peer viem matches the app's.
8. **`UUID round-trip`** — replace `tx.execute("SELECT gen_random_uuid()::text")` with `crypto.randomUUID()`.
9. **Move adapter + port into a single package** once per-node DB schemas are available as shared packages.

 * Module: `@cogni/scheduler-core/types`
 * Purpose: Shared scheduling type definitions and constants (logic-free).
 * Scope: Defines ExecutionGrant, ScheduleSpec, ScheduleRun types and status enums. Does not contain logic.
 * Invariants:
 * - ONLY exports: enums (as const arrays), literal union types, and interfaces
 * - FORBIDDEN: functions, computations, validation logic, or business rules
 * - Grant scopes constrain which graphIds can be executed (GRANT_SCOPES_CONSTRAIN_GRAPHS)
 * Side-effects: none (constants and types only)
 * Links: docs/spec/scheduler.md

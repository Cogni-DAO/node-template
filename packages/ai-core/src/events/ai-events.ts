/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ai-core/events/ai-events`
 * Purpose: Shared AI event types for streaming and billing.
 * Scope: Defines AiEvent union used by all GraphExecutorPort adapters. Does NOT implement functions.
 * Invariants:
 *   - SINGLE_SOURCE_OF_TRUTH: This is the canonical definition; src/types re-exports
 *   - AiEvents are the ONLY streaming output type from ai_runtime
 *   - toolCallId must be stable across start→result lifecycle
 *   - UsageReportEvent carries UsageFact for billing subscriber (never to UI)
 * Side-effects: none (types only)
 * Links: graph-executor.port.ts, GRAPH_EXECUTION.md, LANGGRAPH_SERVER.md

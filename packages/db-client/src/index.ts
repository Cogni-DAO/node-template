/**
 * Module: `@cogni/db-client`
 * Purpose: Safe-surface DB client: app-role factory, adapters, tenant-scope, schema.
 * Scope: App-role factory, adapters, tenant-scope, schema. Does not export createServiceDbClient (BYPASSRLS) — that lives in @cogni/db-client/service.
 * Invariants:
 * - FORBIDDEN: @/shared/env, process.env, Next.js imports
 * - createServiceDbClient is NOT re-exported here (use @cogni/db-client/service)
 * - Re-exports full schema (all domain slices)
 * Side-effects: IO (database operations)
 * Links: docs/PACKAGES_ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/DATABASE_RLS_SPEC.md
 * @public

/**
 * Module: `@cogni/ids`
 * Purpose: Branded ID types for compile-time RLS enforcement across the monorepo.
 * Scope: Type definitions and boundary constructors only. Does not export SYSTEM_ACTOR (lives in @cogni/ids/system sub-path).
 * Invariants:
 * - toUserId() is the single entry point for creating a UserId (validated UUID v4)
 * - userActor() is the only way to create an ActorId from a UserId
 * - User-facing ports accept UserId only — SYSTEM_ACTOR (ActorId) is rejected at compile time
 * - Worker-facing ports accept ActorId
 * - SYSTEM_ACTOR lives in @cogni/ids/system (import-gated for worker/service code only)
 * - Only edge code (HTTP handlers, env parsing, test fixtures) should call toUserId()
 * - No `as UserId` / `as ActorId` casts outside test fixtures — enforced by PR review
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/DATABASE_RLS_SPEC.md
 * @public

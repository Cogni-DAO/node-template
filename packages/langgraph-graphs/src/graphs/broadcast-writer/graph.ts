/**
 * Module: `@cogni/langgraph-graphs/graphs/broadcast-writer/graph`
 * Purpose: Single-call graph for platform-specific content adaptation.
 * Scope: Single-call graph factory for platform content adaptation. Does not execute graphs or read env.
 * Invariants:
 *   - Pure factory function — no side effects, no env reads
 *   - LLM and tools are injected, not instantiated
 *   - No tools — all context is in the user message
 *   - TYPE_TRANSPARENT_RETURN: No explicit return type annotation
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/broadcasting.md, packages/broadcast-core/platform-skills/
 * @public

 * Create a broadcast content writer graph.
 *
 * This is a single-call graph with NO tools:
 * - Receives a platform skill guide + content intent as user message
 * - Makes one LLM call to adapt the content for the target platform
 * - Returns the platform-optimized post in the response
 *
 * Caller is responsible for:
 * - Reading the platform skill doc and including it in the user message
 * - Spawning one graph run per target platform
 * - Parsing the response into a PlatformPost
 *
 * NOTE: Return type is intentionally NOT annotated to preserve the concrete
 * CompiledStateGraph type for LangGraph CLI schema extraction.

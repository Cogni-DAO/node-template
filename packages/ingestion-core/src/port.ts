 * Module: `@cogni/ingestion-core/port`
 * Purpose: Port interface for activity source adapters.
 * Scope: Pure interface. Does not contain implementations — those live in services/scheduler-worker/src/adapters/ingestion/.
 * Invariants:
 * - ADAPTERS_NOT_IN_CORE: This file defines the PORT (interface), not implementations.
 * - All adapter deps (octokit, discord.js) live in the adapter, never in this package.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/epoch-ledger.md#source-adapter-interface

 * Port interface for source adapters that collect activity from external platforms.

 * since the last cursor, normalizes them to ActivityEvent, and returns the events + next cursor.
 *
 * Adapters are stateless — cursor persistence is handled by the calling workflow via
 * ActivityLedgerStore.upsertCursor().

# wait-for-argocd.sh — Block until all ArgoCD Applications for an environment
# have reconciled to EXPECTED_SHA and are Healthy. Called between promote-k8s
# and deploy-infra so that k8s resources are fully rolled out before
# deploy-infra mutates secrets or restarts pods.
#
# Correctness contract: we check `status.sync.revision == EXPECTED_SHA` and
# `status.health.status == Healthy`, not `status.sync.status == Synced`. The
# top-level sync.status is noisy on this cluster because some overlays manage
# EndpointSlices directly and those drift continuously vs. the git manifest,
# leaving apps perpetually OutOfSync even after a successful reconcile. The
# authoritative signal for "did Argo deploy what we pushed" is the revision
# on the last sync operation, not the drift comparator.
#
# Belt-and-suspenders active sync trigger: if an app's sync.revision has not
# caught up to EXPECTED_SHA after ACTIVE_SYNC_AFTER seconds, we kubectl-patch
# the Application to kick an explicit sync. This unblocks deploys in clusters
# where automated sync is misconfigured or the AppSet template drifted (the
# case that wedged preview for a week on deploy/staging pre-bug.0312).
#
# Usage: wait-for-argocd.sh
# Env:
#   VM_HOST             (required) SSH target
#   DEPLOY_ENVIRONMENT  (required) preview | candidate-a | production — used
#                       for the `{env}-{app}` Application name convention
#   EXPECTED_SHA        (optional) git SHA the caller expects Argo to report
#                       as status.sync.revision. Defaults to COGNI_REPO_REF
#                       (the SHA promote-and-deploy just pushed to deploy/{env}).
#                       If unset and COGNI_REPO_REF is also unset, falls back
#                       to legacy "just wait for Synced+Healthy" semantics.
#   ARGOCD_TIMEOUT      (optional, default 300) overall timeout in seconds
#   ACTIVE_SYNC_AFTER   (optional, default 30) seconds of no-progress before
#                       triggering an active sync via kubectl patch
#   SSH_OPTS            (optional) ssh flags

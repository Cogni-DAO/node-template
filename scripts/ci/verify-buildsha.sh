# verify-buildsha.sh — authoritative end-of-deploy gate: assert each node-app
# endpoint serves the SHA the flight claimed to deploy. Catches "green run,
# stale pods" — the pattern where an upstream step silently produced no new
# images (affected-only CI, build failure, wrong overlay), overlays stayed
# unchanged, Argo did nothing, all downstream gates reported green against
# the old pods.
#
# Two modes:
#   1. Single-SHA (preview, candidate): all promoted nodes built from the
#      same PR head SHA. Caller passes EXPECTED_BUILDSHA + NODES.
#   2. Per-app map (production, cross-PR): different nodes built from
#      different PR head SHAs (affected-only CI rebuilt a subset; production
#      copies preview's mixed overlay state). Caller passes SOURCE_SHA_MAP
#      pointing to .promote-state/source-sha-by-app.json — the script asserts
#      each node's /readyz.version matches that node's entry in the map.
#
# Contract (both modes): `/readyz.version` equals the expected SHA for this
# node. Any mismatch is a hard failure regardless of prior workflow status.
#
# Env (single-SHA mode):
#   DOMAIN              (required) base domain (operator Ingress host)
#   EXPECTED_BUILDSHA   (required) PR head SHA — full 40-char hex
#   NODES               (required) CSV of node-app names to verify. MUST be
#                       the set that was actually promoted in this run — do
#                       not default to "operator,poly,resy" because affected-
#                       only CI rebuilds a subset and untouched nodes
#                       legitimately serve a different (prior) PR head SHA.
#                       Pass the empty string to skip (no-op promotion case).
#
# Env (map mode — takes precedence when set and non-empty):
#   DOMAIN              (required)
#   SOURCE_SHA_MAP      path to .promote-state/source-sha-by-app.json. Each
#                       key is an app name; each value is the PR head SHA
#                       that built that app's overlay digest. Unset or
#                       missing file → fall back to single-SHA mode.
#
# Hostname convention: operator → https://$DOMAIN, others → https://$node-$DOMAIN.

# flight-preview.sh — request a preview flight for a merged-PR SHA.
#
# This script does NOT perform the deploy — it is a gate + dispatcher. It
# reads the preview review-state lease, claims it atomically if unlocked,
# and then delegates the actual promote/deploy/verify/e2e work to
# promote-and-deploy.yml via `gh workflow run`.
#
# Called by flight-preview.yml after a PR merges to main (or via manual
# workflow_dispatch). The PR merge gate is authoritative — no external CI
# polling happens here.
#
# Preview review-state contract (files under .promote-state/ on deploy/preview):
#   unlocked   — no flight in progress; safe to claim the lease
#   dispatching— a flight has been dispatched but has not yet reached E2E success
#   reviewing  — last dispatched flight reached E2E success; human review pending
#
# On every invocation:
#   1. candidate-sha is updated unconditionally (high-water mark)
#   2. if review-state is reviewing|dispatching: queue only, no dispatch
#   3. if review-state is unlocked: atomically claim the lease (set review-state
#      = dispatching in the same commit as candidate-sha) and dispatch
#      promote-and-deploy env=preview. promote-and-deploy's lock-preview-on-success
#      step transitions dispatching → reviewing post-E2E.
#
# If two workers race the unlocked → dispatching transition, push_with_retry
# --reread-lease rebases and re-reads review-state. The loser sees dispatching
# and deterministically demotes to queue-only by setting FLIGHT_LEASE_LOST=1.

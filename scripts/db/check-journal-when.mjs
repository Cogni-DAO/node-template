/**
 * Module: `@scripts/db/check-journal-when`
 * Purpose: Fail-loud guard against the silent-skip regression — drizzle-orm's runtime migrator
 *   sorts journal entries by `when` and stamps `__drizzle_migrations.created_at = folderMillis`.
 *   Any entry whose `when` is ≤ the prior entry's `when` (or future-dated past Date.now()) gets
 *   silently no-op'd on candidate-a / preview / prod. Two PRs hit this in April 2026.
 * Scope: Validates every per-node `meta/_journal.json` (Postgres + Doltgres) found in the repo.
 *   Run as part of `pnpm db:check` (pre-push + CI gate).
 * Invariants:
 *   1. Entries' `when` values are STRICTLY MONOTONIC INCREASING in idx order.
 *   2. No entry's `when` is in the future (> Date.now()).
 * Side-effects: stdout/stderr only. exit 1 on violation.
 * Links: docs/spec/databases.md §2.6, .claude/skills/schema-update/SKILL.md
